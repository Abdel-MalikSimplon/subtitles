# Code School Course Subtitles

This repository holds all of the subtitles currently available for Code School courses. 
For now we focus exclusively on English subtitles but if you wish to translate the 
subtitles into a different language we accept pull requests and will deploy these 
subtitles (after review) to our courses for the benefit of all.

## Contributing
Feel free to fork this repository and work on new subtitle files in your own fork. 
Once you've completed at least a whole video subtitle file, feel free to open a pull 
request to discuss it and we'll do our best to get it merged in a timely manner.

Please name the subtitle files as follows:
- `level1-en.srt` for English
- `level1-fr.srt` for French
- `level1-es.srt` for Spanish

You can find a list of the [ISO 639-1 language codes on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) if you're not sure
which one to use.

## Deployment on Code School
We will only release new subtitles to a course when all videos for all levels have 
been translated.
