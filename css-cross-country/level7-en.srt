00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,470
[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,050
You're watching CSS Cross
Country, and this is Level 7,

3
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,445
Sprightly Slaloms.

4
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:34,580
In Level 7 we'll be
discussing image

5
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,130
replacement and CSS Sprites.

6
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,760
Now that we know when to use
images in our layout, let's

7
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,840
take a look at a logo that's
being added as a background

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,680
image in our CSS.

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,840
In this case, Sven's Snowshoe
Superstore has been doing

10
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,720
extremely well and is now Sven's
Snowshoe Emporium.

11
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,750
So on their website we're going
to include their logo as

12
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,640
a background image.

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,050
This type of example works,
but we're using an empty

14
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,440
element for the anchor tag in
which the logo is being added.

15
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,300
This is not best practice as, if
CSS is turned off, or if a

16
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,120
screen reader is trying to read
this, they won't be able

17
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,690
to tell what content
is on the image.

18
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,560
Let's go ahead and add the text
that appears on the image

19
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,560
to our element.

20
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,810
Now, as you might expect, that
text appears over top of our

21
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,390
image, which isn't desired.

22
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,400
But how can we fix this?

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,530
By using the text indent
property of CSS, we can move

24
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,880
the text out of the view port,
so we can still have the

25
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,900
placeholder text but have the
image replace that text.

26
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,990
Let's move on to CSS Sprites.

27
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,560
Let's take a look back at that
imaginary place, Sven's

28
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,300
Snowshoe Emporium logo, and
let's say we want to add a

29
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,090
hover state, which has
a second image there.

30
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,850
We have the initial code, and
we're adding a hover and focus

31
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,740
state for that logo that'll
show a second image when

32
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,600
either of those states occur.

33
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,850
This works fine, but when the
hover or focus state triggers

34
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,110
that second image has
to be loaded.

35
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:09,620
So we're making a second HTTP
request, and since that image

36
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,980
is not preloaded, there's going
to be a flash while that

37
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,090
image loads, which will look
something like this.

38
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,830
To combat this, let's combine
both of those logo

39
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,980
images into one file.

40
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,230
That logo is going to look
something like this, where the

41
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,000
total height of our new images
is 200 pixels, and the height

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,470
of each logo is 100 pixels.

43
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,200
Going back to our example, we're
going to replace that

44
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,055
hover and focus state image
with background position.

45
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:38,930
What background position will
allow us to do is change the

46
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,140
orientation of our image
inside of the element.

47
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,380
So, in this case, we'll add a
background position of zero

48
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,310
and negative 100.

49
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,510
The first value in our
background position property

50
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,280
will be the x-axis shift,
and the second

51
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,620
value, the y-axis shift.

52
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,100
With this background position
applied, when the user hovers

53
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,440
or focuses on our logo, the
orientation of the background

54
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,670
image will shift up 100 pixels
so our second version is shown

55
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,890
to the user.

56
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,640
Also of note, in our original
logo declaration I didn't need

57
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,610
to set the background position
because it defaults to zero

58
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,790
zero, which is the correct
orientation for the default

59
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,160
state of our logo.

60
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,050
When using sprites we have the
advantage of not needing a

61
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,580
second HTTP request, and we
don't need to worry about

62
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,710
using crazy means to
preload our images.

63
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,840
There are many examples on
the web of using sprites.

64
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,680
Here a few examples for
Gmail and GitHub.

65
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,690
Let's take a look at a
bit more complicated

66
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,870
example using sprites.

67
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,590
In this case, we have two
separate icons, one for

68
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,560
Twitter and one for GitHub, and
both will have their own

69
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,130
separate hover state.

70
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,850
Each of the icon parts will be
100 pixels wide and 100 pixels

71
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:54,650
tall, making for a total
image width and

72
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,430
height of 200 pixels.

73
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,050
Here's the initial bit of
code for our icons.

74
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,890
Let's set up our base code to
have two list items with

75
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,410
anchors inside that are set up
next to each other with a bit

76
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,040
of spacing in between.

77
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,630
This example is assuming that
you're using some sort of

78
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,680
reset on our list items,
otherwise you will need to

79
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,589
separately reset the default
styles for li's.

80
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:20,089
When this renders, as you can
see, we're just seeing the

81
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:22,029
text in both of those anchors.

82
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:24,450
Let's move on to our
image replacement.

83
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,630
First, we'll set up the shared
styles for both the Twitter

84
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,700
and GitHub icons using
image replacement.

85
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,870
As you can see, now we have the
Twitter icon for both, but

86
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,550
we need that GitHub icon to
appear in GitHub's place.

87
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,500
Using the background position
property, we can shift our

88
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,670
sprite 100 pixels to the left so
that the GitHub icon in its

89
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,690
resting state will have
the correct image.

90
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:52,210
Now we can add both hover and
focus states to each of the

91
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,630
Twitter and GitHub icons so
that, on hover, the images

92
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,940
will shift down 100 pixels
to show their

93
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,070
hover state like so.

94
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,570
There are a number of great
tools online for dealing with

95
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,520
sprites, including Sprite Cow.

96
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,940
Go ahead and visit link one
to learn more about that.

97
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,660
One last consideration in
dealing with imagery placement

98
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,350
is the base 64 method of
encoding images directly into

99
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,620
our CSS, HTML or JavaScript.

100
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,200
Using this method with syntax
that looks something like

101
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,410
this, you can directly encode
the images into our code and

102
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,980
that allows us to not need
to use sprites or include

103
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,260
separate images.

104
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,810
But it's only available for
versions of IE 8 or greater,

105
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,500
and if you'd like to learn more
about this, go ahead and

106
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,970
visit link two below.

107
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,580
That does it for Level 7.

108
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,700
While you're doing the
challenges, I'm off to stand

109
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,890
in line at the chairlift.

110
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,140
Good luck.
