00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,030

00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,094
[SINGING] An Ember
wrap contains it all.

3
00:00:05,094 --> 00:00:06,760
Your template's big
and sometimes small.

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,301
There are routers,
routes, components

5
00:00:08,301 --> 00:00:09,950
to let Ember models
work for you.

6
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,580
Controllers to help decorate the
views which you can integrate.

7
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,787
Mix them together in December,
Warming Up With Ember.

8
00:00:17,787 --> 00:00:23,280

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,240
You're watching Warming
Up With Ember.js

10
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,740
and this is level
two, where we're

11
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,560
going to be talking a
little more about handlebars

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,880
and some basics of
Ember controllers.

13
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,260
Back in level one,
we learned all

14
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,000
about the router,
which is in charge

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,410
of mapping a path
to an Ember route.

16
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:45,180
But how do we create
links to these routes?

17
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,820
Can't we just hard code
links like you see here?

18
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,030
Well, it turns out
this is a bad practice.

19
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,260
You never want to
hard code your links.

20
00:00:54,260 --> 00:01:00,780
Instead we use the routes to
dynamically retrieve the URLs

21
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,000
when we create links in
our Ember application.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,320
Let me show you what
that looks like.

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,330
To do this, we use a
handlebars link-to helper

24
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:16,060
and send in the route
name we want to link to.

25
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,890
Do this we use the Ember link-to
helper inside of our template.

26
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,940
It allows us to use the route
name to look up the path.

27
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,690
So here you can see
we call a link-to,

28
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,390
send in the route name.

29
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,500
Could be index, could be about.

30
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,670
We then have some text which
is the actual link text.

31
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,110
Then we have to
close our link-to.

32
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,970
Each of these will
determine the path

33
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,020
based on the route
name we send in.

34
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,270
And here's what the resulting
HTML will look like.

35
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:50,440
But what if we want to add
a custom class to our link?

36
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,970
Well, that's pretty simple.

37
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,170
All we have to do
in our link helper

38
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:59,030
is specify class
equals navbar brand

39
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,860
and the rendered HTML will
simply add that class.

40
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,840

41
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,720
Back in our browser, we
can click the About link,

42
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,690
which will bring us to be about
route and the Home link, which

43
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,751
will bring us to
the index route.

44
00:02:16,751 --> 00:02:19,860
If you take a look inside
our devtools inspector,

45
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,790
you'll notice that our
logo has an active class

46
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,570
and our Home link also
has an active class.

47
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,560
About doesn't.

48
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,900
But look what happens
when we click on About.

49
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,210
Now About has the
active class, so it's

50
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:40,610
moved from the Home
link to the About link.

51
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,470
Ember has this nice,
intelligent default

52
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,100
where if you have a
link-to helper, which

53
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,130
is the same route as the one
you're currently visiting,

54
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:54,380
it will give you an
active class on that link.

55
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,200
And as you might imagine, you
can style that appropriately

56
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,855
in your CSS.

57
00:02:57,855 --> 00:03:01,320

58
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,660
Next it turns out, since
we're using Twitter Bootstrap,

59
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:10,980
we need our links to have an li
element and not an a element.

60
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,100
So how might we
switch those tags?

61
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:18,970
Well, the link-to helper
has a tag name option.

62
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:24,600
So if we specify tag name
equals li for both of our links,

63
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,300
sure enough, it's going
to render out two li's

64
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,020
Now you might notice the
href has disappeared.

65
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,390
But it's still going
to work in the browser.

66
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,390
That's because
Ember's smart enough

67
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,380
to hook onto those li
elements and make it

68
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,650
so that the proper
pages are called up

69
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,200
when we click those list items.

70
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,714

71
00:03:47,714 --> 00:03:49,380
So now if we jump
back into the browser,

72
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:54,240
you can see that both of our
links are now list items.

73
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,520
And if we click on About, it
properly goes to that page

74
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,080
and also sets the active class.

75
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,500
Now, if you're following
along using Twitter Bootstrap,

76
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,210
you obviously don't have
our styles or images.

77
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,656
If you want to,
follow the link below,

78
00:04:09,656 --> 00:04:11,030
somewhere around
this video, that

79
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,613
will lead you to the
GitHub repository

80
00:04:12,613 --> 00:04:15,445
where you can download
that style and images.

81
00:04:15,445 --> 00:04:18,124

82
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,540
Time for you to
create some links.

83
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,160
And I'll see you in
the next section.

84
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,754
