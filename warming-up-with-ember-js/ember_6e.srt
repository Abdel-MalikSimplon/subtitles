1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,848

2
00:00:01,848 --> 00:00:04,480
In the previous section,
we split out the reviews

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,250
into its own template.

4
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,690
But what if we wanted to
sort by most recent reviews

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,830
and do this on the client side?

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:17,970
Well, sorting typically happens
in the controller, right?

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,720
So how would we do this?

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,040
What we need to do in this case
is, from that product template,

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,920
go from there to a
ReviewsController.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,040
That's where our
sorting's going to happen.

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,350
It'll then render out
the ReviewsView and then

12
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,230
our reviews Template, which
will no longer be a partial.

13
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:43,170
We do this using
the render helper.

14
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,040
We're going to say
render 'reviews' reviews.

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,290
Basically, that second
reviews is the object

16
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,560
which is going to be
passed into the controller

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,260
and automatically
set as the model.

18
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,960
Then our partials
name is simply going

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,775
to get rid of that underscore
and just be reviews.

20
00:01:00,775 --> 00:01:03,670

21
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,720
So from our product
template, it's

22
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,630
this line-- render
'reviews' reviews-- that

23
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,930
tells Ember to go look
for a ReviewsController

24
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,610
and set reviews as the model.

25
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,680
Let's go ahead and
create our controller.

26
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,580
It's going to be
an array controller

27
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,840
because we have a
list of reviews.

28
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,160
And we're going to set the
sort properties to reviewedAt

29
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,410
and sort it descending.

30
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,260
This is going to use
the reviewed passed in

31
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,350
as the model, as we mentioned.

32
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,730
And it's going to render out
the reviews Template, which

33
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,540
we saw before.

34
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,490
And now, if we go back
to the product page,

35
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:42,117
we can see that we're showing
the newest reviews first.

36
00:01:42,117 --> 00:01:43,950
So really, we have a
bunch of different ways

37
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,880
of rendering templates.

38
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,040
We would use a route when
we have an endpoint URL.

39
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,100
And the route uses a controller
and a view and a template.

40
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,140
We can use the render
handlebars helper

41
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,590
if we need a controller where
we can decorate a model, perhaps

42
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,570
do sorting.

43
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,050
And that's going to have
a view and a template.

44
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,490
Then we can use
a component if we

45
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:11,380
need to create a highly
reusable part of our webpage

46
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,250
that doesn't need a controller
and only gets the information

47
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,690
that we pass into it.

48
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,170
And then lastly,
we have a partial,

49
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,270
which is another
reusable template, which

50
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,550
is going to use the parent
controller-- whatever

51
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,490
it got included from.

52
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,100

53
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,800
You get it?

54
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,220
I know it's a lot of
different helpers,

55
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,260
a lot of different information.

56
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,030
Why don't you jump into some
challenges, let it sink in,

57
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,500
and then I'll see you
in the next level.

58
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,652
