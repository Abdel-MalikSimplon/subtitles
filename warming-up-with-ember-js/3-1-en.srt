1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,030

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,780
[SINGING] An Ember app
contains it all, your templates

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,370
big and sometimes
small, their routers

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,950
roots components to let
Ember Models work for you.

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,580
Controllers to help decorate the
views which you can integrate.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,360
Mix them together, in December
warming up with Ember.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:23,290

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,320
You're watching warming
up with ember.js.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,830
And this is level
three, where we're

10
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,140
going to take a route
through the woods

11
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,400
and learn about resource routes.

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,460
In the last level, we
learned about controllers.

13
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,490
Remember, the name
of the controller

14
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:41,410
matches the name of the
route and the template name.

15
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,870
And then if we take a look
inside the template, remember,

16
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,750
templates use properties
from controllers.

17
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:54,340
Well in this level, we're
going to build a products list.

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,870
So when we click on that
products link up above,

19
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,790
it's going to show all of our
products on our products page.

20
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,190

21
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,580
Obviously, the first step
when we have a new page

22
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,390
we want to add in
our application,

23
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,860
is to add a new route for it.

24
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,380
So here we are
back in our router.

25
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,540
But before we do that,
we need to make sure

26
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,650
we understand the difference
between regular routes

27
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:22,130
and these new routes
called resource routes.

28
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,820
Regular routes are typically
adjectives, verbs, or adverbs.

29
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,270
So an adjective
might be something

30
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,920
like on sale, expiring,
new, or internal.

31
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,572
A verb route might be something
like sign up, ignite, help,

32
00:01:37,572 --> 00:01:38,360
or rate.

33
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,620

34
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,210
Resource routes
on the other hand,

35
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:48,590
are typically nouns,
things like tree,

36
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:52,990
review, books, or contacts.

37
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,440
Notice they can be
singular or plural.

38
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,630
In our case, we have
a list of products

39
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,470
so we're going to call our
resource route products.

40
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,590
And put that up there
inside of our router.

41
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,080
A resource route behaves
a lot like a normal route,

42
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,860
except it has some additional
functionality, which

43
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,640
we'll get to later
in this level.

44
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,710

45
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,325
Just like a route,
if we want to we

46
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:22,840
can pass in an optional
path, as you see here.

47
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,730

48
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,030
We can also define a template
with the same name that

49
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,920
will get rendered when
we go to that route.

50
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,260

51
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,020
Lastly, to add a
link to this route,

52
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,060
we simply do as
we've done before

53
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,000
and say link to
products, tag name

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,235
LI because our links
are list items.

55
00:02:43,235 --> 00:02:46,905

56
00:02:46,905 --> 00:02:50,180
Here you can see if we go
to this URL listed here,

57
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,129
we'll see that the link
has a class of active,

58
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:54,670
because we're in
the product's route.

59
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,190
And it renders the products
template as we'd expect.

60
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,090
To build out this page,
we want to list out

61
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,970
a series of products.

62
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,730
But we want to
pull that list out

63
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,660
of some sort of data resource.

64
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,644
So let's figure out
how to do that now.

65
00:03:11,644 --> 00:03:13,310
To properly do this,
we're going to need

66
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:17,310
another component
called a route.

67
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,620
A route fetches data and passes
it to the Ember controller.

68
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,880
It also decides what model
to use in the current route,

69
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,705
and also decides what template
to render to the screen.

70
00:03:27,705 --> 00:03:30,820

71
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,970
Just to review, every
Ember application

72
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:39,380
has one ember router, which
translates paths into routes.

73
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:44,110
Every application can
have multiple Ember routes

74
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,450
that provides data
for the controllers.

75
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,600
These are two
separate components.

76
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,996
Don't get them confused.

77
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:55,350

78
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,535
Here comes a diagram again.

79
00:03:56,535 --> 00:03:59,260
And as I mentioned a
minute ago, the route

80
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,160
sits between the router
and the controller.

81
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:06,110

82
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,050
Let's solidify
this all together.

83
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,660
So first of all,
we have the router,

84
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,650
which defines a routes
or application needs.

85
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:16,329
In our case, we have a
resource route called products.

86
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:19,079
Then we have the route, which
is responsible for getting data

87
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,363
from external resources.

88
00:04:20,363 --> 00:04:21,779
And just like the
controller, it's

89
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,920
created by Ember if
it's not defined.

90
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,239
This is what the code looks
like that it defines for you.

91
00:04:28,239 --> 00:04:30,530
Then you have the controller,
which decorates the model

92
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,740
and provides property values.

93
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,060
And this is what the default
code looks like for that.

94
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,460

95
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,180
Let's take a look at
a very basic model.

96
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,630
So here you can see we
have an array of products

97
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,180
that we want to render
out into our web page.

98
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,350
We're putting it inside
of our application.

99
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,332
Notice the name space app dot.

100
00:04:52,332 --> 00:04:53,790
At the end of the
next level, we'll

101
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,060
show you how you could pull
this data out of an API.

102
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,440
But for now, we're simply going
to store it in our application.

103
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,790
Then we're going to
define our products route,

104
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,440
specifying the model
property, which

105
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,330
is a function that
returns this array.

106
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,840
The model property
here can either

107
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,720
be an object or an array.

108
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,260
In our case, we have an array.

109
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,251

110
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:18,625
To put it all
together, the route

111
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,580
is responsible for
fetching the model.

112
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,850
Ember will set this
model on the controller.

113
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,240
And that's what will be used
in your handlebar template.

114
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,120
So what would happen if we set
a handlebars template called

115
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,695
products, which simply printed
out the model property.

116
00:05:34,695 --> 00:05:39,900

117
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:44,990
In this case, it would print out
object, object, object, object.

118
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,390
Which is really
just two objects.

119
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:52,130
And those objects, as you
might assume, are our products.

120
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,480
This is obviously an array.

121
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,476
So we'll need to loop
through it to print out

122
00:05:55,476 --> 00:05:56,350
the different values.

123
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,920

124
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,240
To loop using
handlebars, we could

125
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,180
say each product in model.

126
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,520
And then inside there,
specify product dot title.

127
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,710
In this case, it would loop
through each item in the model

128
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,940
array, and print out
the product title.

129
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,510
It would look
something like this--

130
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,140
There's a simpler
way to write this.

131
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,240
Because our template
knows that our data

132
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,410
is inside of our model property.

133
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,460
We can simply write each.

134
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:30,240
And inside each, specify the
properties from the product

135
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,500
that we want to print out.

136
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,600
And our template knows
what we're talking about.

137
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,320

138
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,020
We want to print out
all the information

139
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,500
from all of our products.

140
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,640
So we're going to create
a few more HTML elements,

141
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,320
printing out our properties
with some styling.

142
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,770
And if we go to
our browser, we now

143
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,600
see a list of all
of our products.

144
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,350

145
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,620
Time for you to build some
resource routes and also

146
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,850
some routes.

147
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:00,682
Don't get confused.

148
00:07:00,682 --> 00:07:02,140
But that's what
you're going to do.

149
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,290
It will make more sense
in the challenges.

150
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,890
Go.

151
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:06,390
Go.

152
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,431
What are you waiting for?

153
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:08,540
Go.

154
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,754
