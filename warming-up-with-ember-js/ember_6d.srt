1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,930

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,580
Here we are back in
our Products template.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,960
You notice we have Reviews.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,750
But what if we also show
things like comments,

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,850
related products, products
other customers bought?

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,940
This template will
start to get really big.

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,530
We might want to start
splitting things out,

8
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,850
maybe into their own templates.

9
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,720
Well, let's do
that with Reviews.

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,810
So here we're going to
shrink it down a little bit.

11
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:33,180
And we'll move reviews
into its own template.

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,725
But does it need to
be its own component?

13
00:00:36,725 --> 00:00:38,570
It might be overkill.

14
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,720
What we need to do is create
what's called a partial.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,440
Our partial is going
to be called Reviews.

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,640
So back in our Product
template, we'll

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,540
say Partial Reviews to
render out that partial.

18
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,586
We don't need to pass
anything into a partial,

19
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:54,960
because it's going
to have access

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,820
to everything that this
template already has access to.

21
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,400
We then name our
partial "_reviews."

22
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,620
All partials begin
with an underscore.

23
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,300
If you're familiar with Ruby
on Rails, the idea of a partial

24
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,930
should be really familiar.

25
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,580
If we jump back into
our Products page,

26
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,660
we can see that it's rendering
out just like it was before,

27
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,500
but now the template is
a little more organized.

28
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,080
As I mentioned, partials have
access to all the same things

29
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,400
that the template which called
the partial has access to do.

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,967
So in this case, it's
Product Controller,

31
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:30,550
they have the same
Product Controller.

32
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:35,790
They have access to the same
models and the same properties.

33
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,030
Let's take a look at
the different handlebars

34
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,140
helpers that we've
learned so far compared

35
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,480
to the regular amber route.

36
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,620
So component helper has
both a component object,

37
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,700
and then it renders
out a template.

38
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,354
Or a partial just has
a single template.

39
00:01:56,354 --> 00:01:58,020
Why don't you try
playing with partials?

40
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,470
And then I'll see you
in the next section.

41
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,137
