1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,230

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:04,760
In the previous section,
we hooked up our form.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,870
So here you can see
our new review form.

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,170
And then in the
product controller,

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,480
we created a new action
called create review,

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,360
where we created a new
record and then saved it.

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,870
But if we go into
our browser now,

8
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:26,630
and we type in a new review,
and then we switch products,

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,740
you'll notice that the same
text appears in the text box.

10
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,170
It doesn't get changed
between different products.

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,620
Why is this?

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,070
It turns out that
controllers get reused.

13
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,510
When we switch from product
page to product page,

14
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,400
the only thing that gets
switched out is the model.

15
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,200
If we have properties
that have values in them,

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,030
they stay the same.

17
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,166
So how might we fix this?

18
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:54,540
There are a few
ways to fix this.

19
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,210
But how we're going to do it
is by creating a new review

20
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,300
object that will bind
into the template.

21
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,370
Then back inside
of our controller,

22
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,190
obviously instead of
creating a text property,

23
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,380
we're going to create a review,
which you'll see in a minute.

24
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,030
And then secondly, we'll
need to watch the product

25
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,460
to see if it changes.

26
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:18,220
And if it does, we will need
to create a new review object.

27
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,140
So replacing our
text property, we're

28
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,620
going to create a
property called review.

29
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,450
This is going to
create a new record.

30
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:29,180
Set the product on this
review to the current model.

31
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,970
And lastly, we'll tell
it to watch the model

32
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,300
on this controller,
and if it changes,

33
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,540
then create a new review.

34
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,800
Keep in mind, when we
call create record,

35
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,850
it's not saving a new review.

36
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,430
It's creating a new
instance of a review model.

37
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,929
But it hasn't been
saved anywhere.

38
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:51,470
Now let's jump back
into our template

39
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,990
and use our new review model.

40
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:58,150
So all we have to do here is
set review.doc, review.text,

41
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,570
and review.text.

42
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:04,540
So it's accessing that property
on our new unsaved review.

43
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,990
Now let's jump back into
are controller action,

44
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,370
create review.

45
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,449
This needs to be revised.

46
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:12,426
You can see here that
we're creating a record.

47
00:02:12,426 --> 00:02:14,050
We don't need to
create another record.

48
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:14,990
We just did that.

49
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,890
So that code is
going to go away.

50
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,070
All we really need to do here
is set the controller to this,

51
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,310
get the review to set
the reviewed at date,

52
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,330
and then get the review
again to call save.

53
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,350
Everything else is
pretty much the same.

54
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,710
Now if we jump back into
the browser, let's go ahead

55
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,710
and submit a new review.

56
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,780

57
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,240
It worked.

58
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,650
But our review
form is still there

59
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,610
and the content is still there,
which we probably don't want.

60
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,080
We're only going
to want to submit

61
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,010
one review for a product.

62
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,424
So how do we basically hide that
form when we submit a review?

63
00:02:55,424 --> 00:02:56,840
We're going to do
this by creating

64
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,830
a new property called
is not reviewed.

65
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:04,680
We're going to be checking that,
and if it has been reviewed,

66
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,840
then we don't want
to show the form.

67
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,420
Now back in our
product controller,

68
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,190
we're going to create our is
not reviewed property, which

69
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,825
is going to be a computer
alias of review.isnew.

70
00:03:15,825 --> 00:03:18,420

71
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,565
Is new is a property on
the Ember data model.

72
00:03:21,565 --> 00:03:24,210
As you can see, here's a
couple of different states

73
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,510
that you can check on a model.

74
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,010
There's a lot more
of these that you

75
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,790
can check out in the API Docs.

76
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,370
Now if we jump back
into our browser,

77
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:36,290
and we type in a review,
the review gets added,

78
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:40,520
and our form disappears
as we wanted it to.

79
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,000
And now it's time for you to
go disappear yourself and do

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,720
some challenges.

81
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,626
