1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,050

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,700
So now that we have a
Handlebars template,

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:09,680
how about we put dynamic
content inside of that template?

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,370
Well, as we learn
more about Handlebars,

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:17,230
we'll learn about these things
called Handlebars expressions.

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:22,080
Expressions allow us to insert
a variable into our HTML page.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,090
In this case, we've got Welcome
to {?_[? siteName ?].

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,230
Notice that siteName has
curly braces, two of them

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,430
on either side.

10
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,630
The siteName's value will need
to be provided by our Ember app

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,620
to render it out
on the web page.

12
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,310
But we're not going to cover
how to do that quite yet.

13
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,700
That will be in further levels.

14
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,170
We don't have enough
knowledge yet.

15
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,735
In the meantime, we need
to add a few more templates

16
00:00:44,735 --> 00:00:45,555
to our application.

17
00:00:45,555 --> 00:00:48,950

18
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,410
Remember, our template, right
now, contains three elements.

19
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,390
We have our navigation
bar, our container--

20
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,860
where most of the content
for the page will go--

21
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,540
and our footer.

22
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,020
But our application is going to
contain at least three pages.

23
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,240
Where does the content for
the Home page, About page,

24
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,690
or Product List go?

25
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,950
Well, when we render the About
page, the content for that page

26
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,730
is going to need to get
rendered inside the div

27
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,670
with the class of container.

28
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,790
And also, when we
render the Home page,

29
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,430
we're also going to
have content which

30
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,450
should get rendered inside that
container, which also happens

31
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,630
to be the default we want
to occur when we load up

32
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,320
index.html for the first time.

33
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,100
There's a few steps
we need to take

34
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,035
so that we can have one
index.html and dynamically load

35
00:01:40,035 --> 00:01:42,390
in the contents for the
About or Index page,

36
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,910
depending on which one we want.

37
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,770
And the first step is
to name our templates.

38
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,060
We're going to name our
main template we already

39
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,560
created, the application
template, and then

40
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,785
we're going to create templates
for about and for index.

41
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:03,380

42
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,630
So here we are back
in the code, and we're

43
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,900
going to add a
data-template-name

44
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,940
for our application, like so.

45
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:14,140
This contains the main
layout of our application,

46
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,700
and is going to be
rendered on every page.

47
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,180
Now we're going to create
another template for our Home

48
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,310
page.

49
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,970
We're going to give it the
data-template-name of index.

50
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,490
And inside of a
script tag, we'll

51
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,310
put the HTML for the Home page.

52
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,460

53
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,200
Next, we'll create the about
template, call it about,

54
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,300
and put the proper HTML
content inside the script tag.

55
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:45,150

56
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,430
Now let's load back
up our index.html.

57
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,460
But uh-oh, it's not working.

58
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,836
Our application template's
not even showing.

59
00:02:53,836 --> 00:02:54,960
There's no welcome message.

60
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,130
It should be there.

61
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,870
What's going on?

62
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,100
Well, we forgot one step.

63
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,300
So if we look back
inside of our app,

64
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,960
we'll see that we need a way
to tell our templates where

65
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,250
to render.

66
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,010
So there's our index
template, but it

67
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,370
doesn't know where to render
inside of our main application

68
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,440
template.

69
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,540
To do this, we need to add
an outlet to our application

70
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,200
template.

71
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,720
This tells our code where
to insert templates.

72
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,720
On top of this, when we hit the
Home page, if our application

73
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,060
layout hits an
outlet, it's going

74
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,410
to look for an index
template by default.

75
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,770

76
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,250
And now, sure enough, when
we open up our index.html,

77
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,230
we see that our index
template is rendered inside

78
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,840
of our application template,
as we needed it to.

79
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,640
And now it's time for you to
try this out in the challenges.

80
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,423
