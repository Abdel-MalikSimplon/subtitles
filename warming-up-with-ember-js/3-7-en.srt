1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,330
So we just created our first
dynamic segments inside

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:09,020
of resource routes, as
well as creating a singular

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,370
product for our product route.

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,260
Now we're going to revise
some of our templates.

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,430
We're going to create
a nested template.

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,255
See, right now, in
our products list,

8
00:00:20,255 --> 00:00:24,030
we're rendering that
out in the outlet

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,320
in our application template.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,040
And same thing with our product.

11
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,580
We're rendering
our product inside

12
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,060
of the outlet in the
application template.

13
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,310
To visualize it, we've got
the application template.

14
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,930
And it's got that one outlet.

15
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,260
And both the products
template and the product

16
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,270
template render inside
that single outlet.

17
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,576
But what if we wanted to
do something different?

18
00:00:48,576 --> 00:00:49,950
What if we wanted
to do something

19
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,210
like this, where we have a list
of products on the left hand

20
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,180
side.

21
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,240
And when we click on that, it
shows us that specific product

22
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,530
on the right hand side.

23
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,700
This instance, our
products template

24
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,850
that lists the products is
going to be in one template.

25
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,040
And then inside of
that, there's going

26
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,090
to be another inner template
showing the product.

27
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,150
So basically, we want to
put our product template

28
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,110
displaying one product inside
of our products template, which

29
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,960
is going to list out
all the products.

30
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,760
But how is that possible?

31
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,270
Well, the first
step to doing this

32
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,970
is, of course, to jump
back into the router.

33
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,390
If we're going to
have nested templates,

34
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,260
we're also going to
have a nested route.

35
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,130
In this case, our
product resource route

36
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:47,000
is going to be nested inside
our products resource route.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,570
We're still specifying the
dynamic segment of title

38
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:54,110
but notice it doesn't contain
slash products anymore.

39
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:59,270
This is because it's nested
inside of the products resource

40
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,280
route.

41
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,750
It's simply assumed.

42
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,520
The Ember path that this
creates is products slash title.

43
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,120
That's a dynamic segment.

44
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,900
The route that is going
to call is product.

45
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,370
That product route
keyword is what

46
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,390
it's going to use
to look up if it

47
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:24,570
has a route, or a controller,
or a template of that name.

48
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,020
And the URL that we're going
to use to access this route

49
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,150
is simply products slash Flint.

50
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,090
This is the first step
for nesting a template

51
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,040
within a template.

52
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,230
Next we need to add a new outlet
inside of our products list

53
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,900
to show it where to render
the specific information

54
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,250
about a product.

55
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,620
So here you can see we're
going to specify a new outlet

56
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,910
inside of that
products template.

57
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,630
And that's where the product
template will be rendered.

58
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,840
Here we are in our code.

59
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,950
And as you might notice,
we've changed up our products

60
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,900
template to be a
list of products.

61
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,690
And there at the bottom,
we're going to add an outlet.

62
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,460

63
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,180
Now we go back to the web page.

64
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,030
On the left hand side, you can
see we have our products list.

65
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,760
And when we click
on one of those,

66
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,560
our product template
gets rendered inside

67
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,390
of our products template.

68
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:22,924
Effectively nesting it.

69
00:03:22,924 --> 00:03:26,430
As your application contains
more templates and more routes,

70
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,300
you may need help debugging.

71
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,372
This is where the ember
inspector for Chrome comes in.

72
00:03:32,372 --> 00:03:33,580
It's just for Chrome for now.

73
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,990
And it's just a plug-in you
can install to the browser.

74
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:39,680
And I'm going to show
you what it does.

75
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,030
So here we are
inside of our app.

76
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,570
I'm going to call up dev tools.

77
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,200
You'll see we have
a new ember tab.

78
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,250
Inside that tab, we've
got our View Tree.

79
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,090
So as we scroll through
different templates,

80
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,410
it actually shows
us on our web page

81
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,870
where each of our templates are.

82
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,862
Then if we click on
routes in this tab,

83
00:04:00,862 --> 00:04:03,070
we're going to see a list
of all the routings we have

84
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,545
in our application-- the
name of the routes, the name

85
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:08,780
of the controller, what
template its rendering,

86
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,110
as well as the URL that
would trigger this route.

87
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,232
In this case, we're
at the product route.

88
00:04:14,232 --> 00:04:14,940
But look at that.

89
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,790
There's another route that
we haven't mapped before.

90
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,420
It's products dot index,
which maps to a template

91
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,360
called products slash index.

92
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,260
Bet you wonder what that is.

93
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,580
It turns out this product slash
index template gets rendered

94
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,750
when you go to the
products route,

95
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,960
where we just list
out the products.

96
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,180
And if you have this template,
products slash index,

97
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,140
it's going to load that into
that outlet on the products

98
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,480
template.

99
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,610
That's a little confusing.

100
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:50,360
Don't worry.

101
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,520
It'll be clear in a second.

102
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,410
We're going to create a
template with the name products

103
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,820
slash index.

104
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,990
And it prompts people
to choose a product

105
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,890
from the list on the left.

106
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,254
Now when we go back
to our products list,

107
00:05:03,254 --> 00:05:05,170
you can see that template
show up right there.

108
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,920
Choose a product from
those on the left.

109
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,000
When we click on a product, it
will come to the product page.

110
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,850
Then when we click
on the products

111
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,030
link in the upper
right hand corner,

112
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:21,120
it goes back and shows us that
product slash index template.

113
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,860
One interesting
thing to note here

114
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,850
is that you see how both
the products navigation

115
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,470
list item and the
product link are active.

116
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,310
That's because it's
effectively giving both links

117
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,100
the class of active.

118
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,570
Kind of neat.

119
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,500
Why don't you go try
some nesting on your own,

120
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,020
and I'll see you in level four.

121
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,590
A route-- no router.

122
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,655
--must be our products.

123
00:05:49,655 --> 00:05:51,010
I think I hit the microphone.

124
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,205
Are typically adjects.

125
00:05:52,205 --> 00:05:54,020
Adjects?

126
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,570
Rejects.
