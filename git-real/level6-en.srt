00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,718


2
00:00:02,718 --> 00:00:03,630
Git.

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,970
A distributed source
control repository.

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,390
I tried to picture clusters of
information as they move

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,370
through the file system.

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,820
Were the commit messages
like history books?

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,370
I kept dreaming of
a repository I

8
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,842
thought I'd never see.

9
00:00:17,842 --> 00:00:21,820
And then, one day: Git Real.

10
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:27,600
[MUSIC PLAYING]

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,990
You're watching Git Real, and
this is level six, where we're

12
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,780
going to be talking
about rebase.

13
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,490
So you remember in previous
levels, we talked about merge

14
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,790
commits not being so great.

15
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,650
You've got merge commits from
local branches, merge commits

16
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,270
from remote branches.

17
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,940
And it might seem like it's
polluting your history.

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:45,850
That's not so good.

19
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,170
But there's an alternative to
doing these sort of merges

20
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,080
with merge commits, and
that's called rebase.

21
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,310
So let's jump back into the
scenario we were at before,

22
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,630
where we have Jane's commit up
on GitHub, which is different

23
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,920
than Gregg's commit
that's on local.

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,290
So instead of doing pull and
push, we're going to do fetch,

25
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,540
and then rebase.

26
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,620
So if you remember when we do
fetch, that goes to GitHub and

27
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,960
pulls down any changes, but
doesn't merge them.

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,280
So if we took a look at our
current branch, it looks

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,260
something like this.

30
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,300
We have master and
origin master.

31
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,310
Git rebase does three things.

32
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,710
First, it's going to move all
changes to master, which are

33
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,980
not in origin master.

34
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,840
So it's going to take Gregg's
commit and move that to a

35
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,610
temporary area.

36
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:31,310
Then it's going to run all
of the origin master commits

37
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,640
one at a time.

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,310
So there it goes.

39
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,910
We've run that commit
on master.

40
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,530
And then third step, it's going
to run all the commits

41
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,430
in the temporary area on top of
our master one at a time.

42
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,710
So just like that.

43
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,050
Now as you notice, there's
no merge commits here.

44
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,990
It's just one after the
next, after the next.

45
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,840
Back in level three when we
first learned about local

46
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,130
branches, remember we had this
admin branch, and then we had

47
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,070
to go back and fix
some bugs on master.

48
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,150
And then we had to merge
the admin into master.

49
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:05,130
Well, how might we rebase
instead of doing merge?

50
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,330
Well, what we might do is first
check out the admin

51
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,790
branch, then run git
rebase master.

52
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,190
This is going to first run the
master commits, and that's

53
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,930
going to run our additional
admin commits.

54
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,030
Then the next step is to check
out the master branch, and

55
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,200
then merge from the admin
back into master.

56
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,260
All this is going to do is one
of those fast forwards that we

57
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:27,950
talked about.

58
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,220
So it's just going to run the
same commits one after the

59
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,200
next, after the next, and
we're good to go.

60
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,760
Even if we're running
rebase, we still

61
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,940
might run into conflict.

62
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,460
So let's take a look at a
scenario with a conflict.

63
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,260
As you can see here, up on
GitHub we have an extra

64
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,610
commit, as we do locally.

65
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,180
And those two extra commits
both modify

66
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,570
that same readme file.

67
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,420
OK.

68
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,770
So step one, we fetch
from GitHub.

69
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,110
Step two, we run git rebase.

70
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,780
That's going to take all of our
new commits from master,

71
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,450
and move them into
a temporary area.

72
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,710
Then it's going to run all of
the origin master commits.

73
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,750
And then finally, it's going to
run all of the commits in

74
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,630
the temporary area one at a
time, which of course is going

75
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,420
to lead to a conflict.

76
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,260
So here is what you see when
rebase runs into a conflict.

77
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,890
You can see it's asking us to
fix the merge conflict in

78
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:20,170
readme.txt, and when we resolve
the problem, run git

79
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,550
rebase --continue.

80
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,160
However, if we want to skip the
patch, we could run git

81
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,840
rebase skip.

82
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,120
Or if we want to roll back and
pretend we never rebased, we

83
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,870
can just do it git
rebase abort.

84
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,180
If we ran a git status, we would
see that we're not on

85
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,330
any particular branch.

86
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,760
We're in the middle
of the rebase.

87
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,290
So after we edit the readme,
we do git add readme.

88
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,050
Then we type git rebase
--continue, and it continues

89
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,030
applying the commits.

90
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,410
If we took a look at the commit
messages at this point,

91
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,940
it would look something
like this.

92
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,820
So once again, you can see there
is no merge conflict.

93
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,240
It's all just one after the
next, and feels a bit cleaner.

94
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,740
I'm not saying that rebase is
the answer all the time.

95
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,820
Sometimes you might want to
rebase, sometimes you might

96
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,920
want to merge.

97
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,860
If you're dealing with a branch
that's been around for

98
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,510
a long time and it has a lot of
changes, you probably want

99
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,200
to do a merge instead
of a rebase.

100
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,690
That way you know exactly when
it got merged back in, and you

101
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:15,790
have a log of everything that
got changed in that one merge

102
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,880
when it came over.

103
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,470
Yeah.

104
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,310
So it's time for you
to get your hands

105
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,330
dirty, and do some rebasing.

106
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,666
