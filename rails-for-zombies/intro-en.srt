00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
So you're probably wondering,
what is Rails For Zombies?

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,680
Well, the short answer is that
it's an interactive tutorial

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,920
to teach the basics of web
application development in the

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,790
browser using Ruby on Rails.

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,010
But here's the long answer.

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,160
In the world of technical
learning, you've got books and

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,360
you've got screen casts, neither
of which has any

8
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,290
interactivity.

9
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,120
But come on, this is the
Nintendo generation.

10
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,170
Give me a damn joystick.

11
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,220
Plus, then there's the
configuration issues.

12
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,380
No matter how easy it is to set
up your computer to code

13
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,060
rails, you'll likely figure out
some way to screw it up

14
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,910
and it may not even
be your fault.

15
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,900
When you're diving into
something new, it needs to be

16
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,700
fun and not give you the feeling
that you've been

17
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,980
thrown into the deep end.

18
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,550
By the time you get
to the water, you

19
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,890
should be booking it.

20
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,520
Ruby on Rails is supposed
to be all ponies

21
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,840
and rainbows, right?

22
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,440
So you should at least have
rainbow colored floaties or be

23
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,660
armed with maybe some pistols
or maybe even a shotgun.

24
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,790
Oh yeah, a shotgun.

25
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,370
But speaking of shotguns, you
have to be asking what does

26
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,070
this have to do with zombies?

27
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,350
Well, that's where our example
application comes in.

28
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,070
You see, Twitter is always a
good example for beginners.

29
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,510
However, that's been overdone,
so we need to

30
00:00:58,510 --> 00:00:59,810
find something new.

31
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,170
Recently I've learned
about zombie walks.

32
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,700
It's where people in big cities
dress up like zombies,

33
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,140
meet in a single location, and
wander the streets as the

34
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:06,960
living dead.

35
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,350
It actually happens all over
the country, and in Seattle

36
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,220
they had over 4,000 zombies
walking through downtown.

37
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,750
But again, what does this have
to do with Rails for Zombies?

38
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,620
Well, if you do that zombie
walk and you find some

39
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,820
delicious brains, you're going
to need a way to tell your

40
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,670
fellow zombies about it.

41
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,410
Thus, the application
we'll be building

42
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,920
is Twitter for Zombies.

43
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,290
Makes perfect sense, right?

44
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,980
So how does this zombie
thing work?

45
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,670
Well first, if you're not
familiar with the Ruby

46
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,015
language, head over to
tryruby.org and follow through

47
00:01:33,015 --> 00:01:34,400
the Ruby tutorial there.

48
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,660
Then head back over to
Railsforzombies.org and click

49
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,720
the Start Course Now button
on the homepage.

50
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,770
You'll be taken to the first
video lesson for the course.

51
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,860
You can skip to a chapter
at the top if you

52
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,690
want to skip ahead.

53
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,760
And when you're done, just click
on the big green button

54
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,970
to start the challenges where
you'll have to do some coding

55
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,150
to get to level two.

56
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,590
In the challenge interface,
you'll see your total points,

57
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,020
the points you can earn from
this challenge, and the

58
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,240
challenge instructions.

59
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,270
To solve the challenge, you'll
need to write some code using

60
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,440
our in-browser code
editor here.

61
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,430
If you don't get it
right, you'll

62
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,670
see some error messages.

63
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,710
And if you're stuck, you can
take a look at some hints to

64
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,620
help keep pushing you forward.

65
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,220
Once you type in the correct
answer, you'll get a

66
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,289
congratulations screen where
you can continue on to the

67
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,780
next challenge or try
some extra credit.

68
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,550
The extra credit isn't verified,
it's just an

69
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,780
opportunity to practice
your rails coding.

70
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,630
Once you're ready to move on, on
the left side of the screen

71
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,015
you can jump around to
the other challenges.

72
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,530
Where you watch the video
lesson, learn the interface

73
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,370
shortcuts, or download
the video lesson

74
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,000
slides for later reference.

75
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,750
Once you finish Rails for
Zombies, you'll receive a

76
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,810
badge for your public profile,
unlock the final video.

77
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,470
And finally, you'll receive $5
in Code School cash that you

78
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,300
can use to enroll in Code School
and get access to Rails

79
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,130
for Zombies 2, Rails Testing for
Zombies, and Testing with

80
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,460
Rspec, along with all our other
courses and Code TV

81
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,570
screen casts.

82
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,330
Rails for Zombies is graciously

83
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,640
sponsored by New Relic.

84
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,685
Providing rails developers the
tools they need to monitor

85
00:02:47,685 --> 00:02:49,630
their application performance.

86
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,800
Enough talk, it's time to learn
some Rails for Zombies.

87
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,333
