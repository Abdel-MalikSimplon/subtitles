00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,410
[SINGING]

2
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,036
While on jQuery Air, you'll
arrive super quick.

3
00:00:04,036 --> 00:00:06,080
With our in-flight
service you'll

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,610
learn code with a click.

5
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:11,260
Yes, now all this and more
taught by Greg Pollack.

6
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,203
We hope you enjoy your flight.

7
00:00:14,203 --> 00:00:16,470
I'm Greg, and I'll be
your Captain this

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,030
evening on jQuery Air.

9
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,560
In Level 3, we're going to be
talking all about effects and

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,310
the advanced things you can do
with them, starting with

11
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,350
chaining effect and
adjusting speed.

12
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,500
We'll look at how to create
our custom effects by

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,120
manipulating CSS.

14
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,510
We'll then talk about
effect easing--

15
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,810
so that's sort of the rate at
which the effects come in.

16
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,780
Using a queue, how you
might do that.

17
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,160
Then we'll talk about adding
delays to your effects, and

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,430
finally, how to stop them
when you need to.

19
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,200
Let's take a look back
at the application

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,990
we've built so far.

21
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,910
So here, you can see we click
on a price, and that

22
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,130
brings up the login.

23
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,300
We can log in, and then we
have our trip total.

24
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,030
Cool.

25
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,470
That login box that
I showed you?

26
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,020
Wouldn't it be nice if that
faded out and then faded back

27
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,019
in when I got back from
that AJAX request?

28
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,570
How might we do that using
effect chaining?

29
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,200
So, we're going to chain
the effects.

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,340
We're going to fade out, load in
the HTML, and fade back in.

31
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,910
When you run multiple effects
on the single element, it's

32
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,270
going to chain them together.

33
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,780
So it's going to run one, and
then the next, and the next.

34
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,430
It's not going to run
them all once.

35
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,410
It's going to wait until the
first one's done, and then run

36
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,360
the next, and the next.

37
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,150
Definitely check out the
documentation if you want to

38
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,700
read about the different effects
you have available.

39
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,390
So here we are back
in the browser.

40
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,270
We click on a price.

41
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,700
We get the login button.

42
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,960
We click on it, it fades
out, and then back in.

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,660
I'm going to show you
that one more time.

44
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,680
Pay close attention.

45
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,390
It's not quite right.

46
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,390
Notice how the HTML changes as
it's fading out, and then it

47
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,840
fades back in, which isn't the
real behavior we want.

48
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,510
We want to make it so that it
fades out, then it changes the

49
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,230
HTML back from the AJAX call,
and then it fades back in.

50
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,970
How might we do that?

51
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,200
We can do that using
a callback.

52
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,190
So that fade out method, it
takes a function as one of its

53
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,020
parameters, and inside that
function we can say, this is

54
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,900
what we want you to call after
the fade out is done.

55
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,260
So in this case, after the fade
out is done, it's going

56
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,640
to load the HTML and
then fade back in.

57
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,010
If we wanted to, we could
adjust speed as well.

58
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,640
So we could say, fade
out fast, and then

59
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,960
fade back in slowly.

60
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,290
In case you're wondering what
fast and slow is, and what the

61
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,450
default speed is for
these effects, it's

62
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,500
something like this.

63
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,400
Fast is 200 milliseconds.

64
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,750
Default is 400 milliseconds.

65
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,530
Slow is 600 milliseconds.

66
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,900
And of course, for all
these, you can send

67
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,150
in your custom time.

68
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,180
For example, here I'm sending
in 1,000, which is 1,000

69
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,100
milliseconds.

70
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,370
So in this case, it's going
to fade out in one second.

71
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,330
So with this new callback, if we
go back into the login, we

72
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:56,220
can see it properly fades out,
then changes the HTML, and

73
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,750
then fades back in.

74
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,120
Very nice.

75
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,300
So as you can see, when we get
back from that AJAX call, we

76
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,230
also set the background
color on the total

77
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,690
price to that brown.

78
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,880
But what if we wanted to call
that out even more?

79
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,660
One way we could do that is
by specifying the animate

80
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,770
function, and we could tell
it what to animate.

81
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,990
In this case, we change the
height of that row to 30.

82
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,230
We also might want to make the
text flash a little bit.

83
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,510
One way we could do this is by
setting the opacity to 0.5,

84
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,870
and then animate it
back up to 1.

85
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,970
It should also be said that
I can use classes and CSS

86
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,450
animations to do
these effects.

87
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,920
However, not all browsers out
there are going to support CSS

88
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,150
animation, so if I wanted to be
the most compatible, this

89
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,300
might be how I do it.

90
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,700
Here we are back
in our browser.

91
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,220
Let's go ahead and see
what it looks like.

92
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,070
We log in.

93
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,410
Ah, it animates pretty nice.

94
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,640
Let's look at it
one more time.

95
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,890
Very cool.

96
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,650
Next up, we're going to
talk a little bit

97
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,570
about effect easing.

98
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,560
So what easing is talking about
is the rate at which the

99
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,880
effect goes from its starting
point to its ending point, and

100
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,740
to jQuery library by default
comes with two different

101
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,980
easing methods.

102
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,100
We have linear and swing.

103
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,140
And by default, swing is going
to be used in our effects.

104
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,920
Take a look at what
these mean.

105
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,200
So here, you can see each of
these sort of sliding up and

106
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,790
sliding down using different
types of easing.

107
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,220
Linear is sort of all at the
same pace, and swing starts

108
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,640
out fast and then slows down.

109
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,900
The jQuery UI library comes with
a bunch more easing

110
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,430
methods, as you can see
in this window.

111
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,890
You don't need to worry about
these for now, but if you want

112
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,000
more information, at the end of
this course, I'll give you

113
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,880
a link to this page where you
can try out all the different

114
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,190
easing methods.

115
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,570
Let's jump back into
our jQuery and

116
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,050
change some of the easing.

117
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,960
So here, we're going to change
the confirm purchase to a

118
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,600
linear easing.

119
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,180
Also, we're going to go into our
animate function there and

120
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,000
change that also to linear.

121
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,410
And let's see what that looks
like in our browser.

122
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,080
It's going to be really hard
to see the difference.

123
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,400
That's just the way it goes
when you have your effects

124
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,690
going this quickly.

125
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:14,815
But if I slowed it down, it
would be more obvious.

126
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,610
So we're about halfway
done with Level 3.

127
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,150
Next up, we're going to be
talking about queuing.

128
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,550
So, if you look back here at
this login code-- let's take

129
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,750
one more look at it.

130
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,060
With successful login, it
basically returns, it fades

131
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,170
out, it loads in the new HTML,
and then fades back in.

132
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,510
Now, looking at this code, it
made me wonder, wait a second.

133
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:36,790
Why are we fading out after
the AJAX comes back?

134
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,070
Shouldn't we be fading out,
making the AJAX call, and then

135
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,950
fading back in when
it comes back?

136
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,870
So let's refactor that.

137
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,420
So let's bring the fade
out up into right

138
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,720
above the AJAX call.

139
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,280
And if we wanted to, we could
put that in the before send in

140
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,900
the AJAX callback, but above
it's probably fine, too.

141
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,840
So let's go ahead and see what
that does in the page.

142
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,480
So we log in.

143
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,210
Uh oh.

144
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,250
We're running into
that issue again.

145
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,310
You see it?

146
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,520
Where it's actually updating
that div, and then fading out

147
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,020
and fading back in.

148
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,960
We can't use the callback like
we did before because it's in

149
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,000
two different places.

150
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,010
One's coming back from the
server, and one's getting

151
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,860
called before we call AJAX.

152
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,560
So this is where we might
want to use a queue.

153
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,320
See up here at the top?

154
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,720
We're going to attach this queue
to the login element,

155
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,290
and inside there is where we're
going to load in the

156
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,590
HTML, and then fade it in.

157
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,570
Using the queue syntax,
you have to be aware

158
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,280
of this next parameter.

159
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,990
So we send the next in, and then
we call next at the end

160
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,960
of that code block so
that it'll call the

161
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,670
next item in the queue.

162
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,340
One more thing we might want to
do here before we see what

163
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,200
happens in our browser, we
might want to make that

164
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,060
confirm box happen afterward.

165
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,120
So first, we're going to
have the login box fade

166
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,340
out, fade back in.

167
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,600
Only once it's complete do we
want to draw the user's

168
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,870
attention to the total box
and the submit button.

169
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,870
So to do that, we're
going to jump back.

170
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,900
We're not going to use
the queue again.

171
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,950
We're going to do that
callback function.

172
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,830
So we're going to take this
code, put it as a

173
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,130
callback to fade in.

174
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,510
So after its done fading
in, call these methods.

175
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,560
Here we are back
in our browser.

176
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,850
So we click login, it fades
out, fades back

177
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,900
in, and shows us--

178
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,540
let's look at that
one more time.

179
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:31,910
Fades out, fades back in,
and shows us the button.

180
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,630
Next up, remember our tool
tips up there at the top?

181
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,350
They hover and they pop up.

182
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,320
Well, let's make them a little
more user friendly.

183
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,220
This time let's make them sort
of fade in and then fade out,

184
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,440
and maybe add a delay.

185
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,560
So like, when you hover
over it, it doesn't

186
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,330
appear right away?

187
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,560
Like a real tool tip.

188
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,000
So here we are, back in our
showNumberOfFlights

189
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,410
function, and then we also
have our hideNumberofFlights

190
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,280
function.

191
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,760
And all we need to do there to
add fade in, fade out, and

192
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,050
delay is write
delay(300).fadeIn, just like

193
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,480
so, and then down below, we're
going to fade out, and we're

194
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,000
going to only remove
the element once

195
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,450
the fade out is complete.

196
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,750
Otherwise, it would just
make it disappear.

197
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,070
All right.

198
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,800
Back in our browser,
let's check it out.

199
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,890
Hey, that looks nice.

200
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,110
We hover, and it feeds
in and fades out.

201
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,950
Pretty cool, but
there's a bug.

202
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,090
See what happens when
we scroll our mouse

203
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,010
over all of the tabs?

204
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,580
It's not so nice.

205
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,990
So let's try to fix that, so
that when we move the mouse

206
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,408
across the page, we don't have
cascading tool tips.

207
00:08:39,408 --> 00:08:40,740
So here we are, back
in our code.

208
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,920
All we need to fix this is
add the stop variable.

209
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,140
So, stop is going to stop the
effect wherever it is.

210
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,900
And in this case, it's
going to stop, and

211
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,780
then just fade out.

212
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,090
So, let's take a look.

213
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,080
Now we could scroll
over all of them.

214
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,625
Nothing appears until we hover
over it for a little while,

215
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,475
and it's much nicer.

216
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,425
Pretty cool.

217
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:05,325
[MUSIC PLAYING]

218
00:09:05,325 --> 00:09:07,430
Looks like you made it all the
way to level Three 3, so it's

219
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,780
time to get your hands dirty.

220
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,910
Go through those challenges
and practice your effects.
