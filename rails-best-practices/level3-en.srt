00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,930
You're watching Rails Best
Practices, Super Deluxe

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:04,670
Championship Edition.

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,810
I'm Gregg Pollack, and
this is lab three.

4
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,010
When we talk about model best
practices, the most common

5
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,810
thing you hear over and over
is that us Rails developers

6
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:38,470
need to get better at indexing
our foreign keys in our

7
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,580
database, right?

8
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,410
So obviously, if we're going
to do current_user.tweets,

9
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,120
we're going to want to
have a migration

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,680
that adds that index.

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,010
Hopefully we added it when we
created the table in the first

12
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,620
place, but you can add it after
the fact if you have to.

13
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,970
But let's take a look at
a more complex example.

14
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,900
Let's say we have a series
of queries here in our

15
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,100
application that
get run a lot.

16
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,860
So we need to make sure that we
have the proper indexes in

17
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:04,900
our database.

18
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,460
What might those indexes
look like?

19
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,240
Well, for the first query, you
might want to add an index

20
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,070
that looks like this.

21
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,050
It's a compound index of the
user_id and created_at field.

22
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,510
So you even need to index stuff
that you're ordering by.

23
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,980
That's important.

24
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,010
So the second query, where we're
doing a topic, you might

25
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,000
want to add the compound
index with started_training

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and mentions.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,320
So again, something from
the where clause

28
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,570
and the order clause.

29
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,650
There's two things you really
want to keep in mind when it

30
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,030
comes to indexes.

31
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,600
First of all, the more indexes
you have, the longer it takes

32
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,210
to re-index the table.

33
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,630
So every time you create a
record or update a record, the

34
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,790
more indexes you have, the
slower it's going to happen.

35
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,080
The second thing you need to
keep in mind is that if you

36
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,840
have a query, a long running
query, that only runs a few

37
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,980
times a week, who really
cares, right?

38
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,300
When it comes to your database,
you should only be

39
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,660
really caring about the queries
that take a long time,

40
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,190
and are getting run
very often.

41
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,120
How do you figure out what
those queries are?

42
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,110
Well, you might want to use
a tool like New Relic.

43
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,050
Here's some screens
from New Relic.

44
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,970
So New Relic RPM gives you, over
here, the queries that

45
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,950
are the most time-consuming.

46
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,380
This is one table they have.

47
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,020
They also have a database
report.

48
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,840
If you look closely here, you
can see-- now this is the most

49
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,290
popular query, total time it
takes, and the average time.

50
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:29,070
So in this case, even though
it's a popular query, it only

51
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,100
takes 6.4 milliseconds
to run, so we don't

52
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,380
really need to refactor.

53
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,080
If, on the other hand, it was
taking, say, 300, 400

54
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,510
milliseconds, you might want to
look and see if maybe we're

55
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,760
missing an index.

56
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,320
A few years ago, the
guys from Less

57
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,400
Everything wrote this article.

58
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,710
The title is "Use Attribute
Protected or We Will Hack

59
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:54,010
You." And they basically showed
some of the code they

60
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,040
used to hack a friend
of theirs' website.

61
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,200
The most important bit here is
right here, where you can see

62
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,560
that they're writing an is_admin
column to true on the

63
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,410
new users that they're
creating.

64
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,280
So obviously, to protect
yourself, you need to make

65
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,280
sure that you're doing
one of two things.

66
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,840
In their article, they used
attribute protected is admin

67
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,430
to protect that column
from batch updates.

68
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,490
However, there's another way you
can write that, and it's

69
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,610
more of a best practice.

70
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,010
Really, you should be using
attribute accessible rather

71
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,150
than protected, because when
it comes to security, white

72
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,170
lists are better, right?

73
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,280
This is so you don't shoot
yourself in the foot later.

74
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,130
You might add columns later, and
you want to force yourself

75
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,600
to have to add that column to
attribute accessible if you

76
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,470
want it to be able
to batch update.

77
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,035
Otherwise, it'll stay safe.

78
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,830
I'm going to show you some model
code, and I want you to

79
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,570
try to figure out what's
wrong with it.

80
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,750
So before we create, we're
setting a time zone.

81
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,150
What's wrong with this?

82
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,630
Well, if we're always setting a
column to a static default,

83
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,550
we shouldn't be doing
that in the model.

84
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,330
We should be doing that
in our database.

85
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,980
Our database has that ability.

86
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,590
So here, you can see a migration
where we're changing

87
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:22,650
the column to give it
the default of EST.

88
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,120
Now let's take a look at an
example where we couldn't set

89
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,440
the default in the database.

90
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,760
So here you can see,
we have before

91
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,860
create, set trend, ending.

92
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,450
So whenever we create this
topic, we're going to set the

93
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,230
time when it should
finish trending.

94
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,470
And if you do the math here,
you'll see that basically

95
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,530
we're saying, finish trending
one week from now.

96
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,500
Rails comes with a set of date
helpers, which can help us

97
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,580
simplify code that
looks like this.

98
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,680
So instead of having that math
there, we can say time now

99
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,250
plus 1.week.

100
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,880
We can even take it a step
further, and make it so that

101
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,100
finish trending is

102
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,910
1.week.from_now

103
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,530
Pretty nice.

104
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,490
If our application had a lot
of topics, and we want to

105
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,580
optimize this code, there's
something we can do to make it

106
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,880
even better.

107
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,550
You see that 1.week?

108
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,760
Every time this method gets
called, every time a topic is

109
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,860
created, we're calling 1.week?

110
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,410
So to make it even better, what
we can do is take the 1.week,

111
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:24,630
move it up into a global
variable we're going to call

112
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:28,020
TRENDING_PERIOD, and then we
write TRENDING_PERIOD.from_now

113
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,890
in our method, and that
means 1.week is only going to

114
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,350
be run once.

115
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,290
I thought it'd be useful at this
point to take a look at

116
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,990
all the different call
backs we can use on

117
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,830
Active Record models.

118
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,780
So you can see here, these are
all the call backs when we

119
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,980
create an object, updating
an object,

120
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,230
and deleting an object.

121
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,420
Also, I want to make sure you
know about all the different

122
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,120
Rails date helpers.

123
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,280
So you've got the ability to
do 1.minute, 2.hours,

124
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:58,750
3.days.

125
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,600
You can use the singular
or the plural form.

126
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,110
You can also do things like
beginning_of_day, beginning_of_week,

127
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,350
or end_of_month, end_of_quarter
next_week, previous_week,

128
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,430
and then you can
add modifiers onto

129
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,960
the end, like 2.weeks.ago

130
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,190
or 3.weeks.from_now.

131
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,200
So you know how when somebody
follows you on Twitter, you

132
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,910
get an email that looks
something like this.

133
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,790
So let's think about a moment.

134
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,850
What happens there?

135
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,780
So somebody follows you, it
probably puts something onto a

136
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,970
background queue, and
then sends an email.

137
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,000
What might that code
look like?

138
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,680
So here's our Following model.

139
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,900
And after_create, we want to
send_follower_notification.

140
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,360
We want to check to see the user
wants to receive emails,

141
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,050
and if they do, queue up
a new_follower_email.

142
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,330
The first way we could refactor

143
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,990
this code is by moving the
method to queue up the email

144
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,800
into the after create, and then
specify a method that's

145
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,800
going to call to check
to see if it's true.

146
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,610
So it's only going to queue up
an email if that if method

147
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,290
returns true.

148
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:10,330
The next way we can simplify
this even further is by

149
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,200
wrapping the whole thing
inside of a proc.

150
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,240
So it's going to run this proc
to see if it's true.

151
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,960
If it is true, then it will
queue up a new follower email.

152
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,700
Next up, let's take a look at
a custom validation, and

153
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,900
figure out how we can
improve on it.

154
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,690
So here, you can see that we're
validating to see if the

155
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:35,160
name is suitable, basically
checking for swear words, and

156
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,180
if it's not suitable, if it's
inappropriate, then we're

157
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,030
going to go ahead and add an
error to this model for the

158
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,850
name, which is now
inappropriate.

159
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,900
So how can we improve
this code?

160
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,220
The first thing we can do is
wrap validation itself in a

161
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,170
method we're going to call
appropriate content.

162
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,370
We're then going to say validate
appropriate content,

163
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,760
and it will get run when we
attempt to save the model.

164
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,380
However, there may be multiple
fields in our application--

165
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,720
not just in this model, but in
other models that we want to

166
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,200
check to see if it has
any bad words in it.

167
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,120
How might we do that and
reuse this code?

168
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,860
Well, it might look something
like this.

169
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,970
So first of all, in our topic,
we're going to do validates

170
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,170
name appropriate true.

171
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,580
So just basically going to
follow the same convention for

172
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,260
doing validations.

173
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,900
Then we're going to create
a new file called

174
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,860
appropriate_validator.rb.

175
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,340
We're going to put it in
our lib directory.

176
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,340
This class is, of course,
going to be called

177
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,170
AppropriateValidator, and it's
going to extend from

178
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,420
ActiveRecord::EachValidator.

179
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,250
It has to define a method called
validate_each, which

180
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,669
sends in record, attribute,
and value-- all the values

181
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:42,080
that we're pretty much
interested in.

182
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,110
So ContentModerator
is suitable.

183
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,710
We want to check, just make sure
the value is suitable,

184
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:52,290
and if it's not, we're going to
add an error to the record,

185
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,410
and say that attribute
is inappropriate.

186
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,860
One thing that's worth
mentioning before we move on

187
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,030
is that you shouldn't forget
to require this.

188
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:05,480
Depending on where you put this
EachValidator file, you

189
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,850
may need to require it at
the top of your model.

190
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,930
In this case, I put it in the
lib directory, and lib isn't

191
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:18,020
autoloaded by default anymore
with Rails 3.

192
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,140
What that means is that to make
this work, I would have

193
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,820
to add that require line
at the top of my model.

194
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,040
If I made it so that everything
in the lib

195
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,120
directory was autoloaded,
then I wouldn't have

196
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,370
to worry about it.

197
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,520
If you've been creating Rails
applications for a long time,

198
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,040
you definitely did something
ugly, which look like this at

199
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,870
some point, where inside of your
migration, you created

200
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,545
models in the database, what
you might call seeds.

201
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,650
Well, back in Rails 2, we
were given a better way

202
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,720
to deal with this.

203
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,430
We have a seeds.rb file in our
DB directory, and we can put

204
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,560
all of these model create
methods in there.

205
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,920
To run these models, you
just run rake db:seed.

206
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:06,672
However, in this case, I ran
this, and it wasn't working.

207
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,410
Do you know why that was?

208
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,740
Well, I looked inside the topic
model, and it turns out

209
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,250
I had attribute protected in
there, so mentions wasn't

210
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,850
getting set when I tried
to set it this way.

211
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,590
To fix that, I refactored it.

212
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:24,510
I put all the topics I wanted
to store inside of a hash,

213
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,690
iterated through each of the
topics, and then created each

214
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,400
of them by setting the
variables explicitly.

215
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,510
You'll notice here, I'm
using the block syntax

216
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:36,460
of the create method.

217
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,400
It kind of makes it a little
bit more readable.

218
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,120
But what if we wanted to be
able to update the seed?

219
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,870
So maybe I've got another couple
topics I want to add,

220
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,800
but I've already populated
my database.

221
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,960
I want to be able
to update it.

222
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,095
What code would I add to this?

223
00:10:50,095 --> 00:10:53,400
Well, one way I could solve
this problem is by adding

224
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,600
topic . destroy all, so that
every time I ran this file, it

225
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,420
would destroy all the topics
and recreate them.

226
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,740
However, this is a little bit
dangerous, for a few reasons--

227
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,590
one of which is that if a lot of
relationships, you've got a

228
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,610
lot of models, lot of seeds that
relate to each other, it

229
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,180
might be dangerous to just go
around deleting stuff, because

230
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:16,720
you might be left with stray
models in your database.

231
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,060
So how do we fix that?

232
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,270
Well, one way we could do
that is by using

233
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,390
find_or_initialize_by_name.

234
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,400
So what this is going to do is
it's going to go into the

235
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,730
database, search for a topic
by the attribute name.

236
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,990
If it doesn't find it,
then it's going to

237
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,730
create a new one.

238
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,260
But if it does find it, it's
just going to return that.

239
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,900
So either we're going to find
it or create a new one.

240
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,520
Then I'm calling
the tap method.

241
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,690
The tap method just sends in the
object that got returned

242
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,870
by the finder initialize by, and
then I'm going to set the

243
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:55,110
mentions, and then I'm
going to save it.

244
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,010
Sorry if you've never seen
those two methods before.

245
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,680
It may seem a little
overwhelming.

246
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,420
So find_or_initialize_by tries
to find the object.

247
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,190
If it does find it,
it returns it.

248
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,470
Otherwise, it initializes
it and returns it.

249
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,640
And tap is just going
to send whatever it

250
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,470
returns into the block.

251
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,900
So it's basically going to set
t equal to whatever it

252
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,800
returns, and then we can
basically set mentions, and

253
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,280
then call t.save.

254
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,320
Congratulations.

255
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,610
You're over halfway done now,
and it's time to get your

256
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,820
hands dirty with the level
three challenges.

257
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,070
Good luck.
