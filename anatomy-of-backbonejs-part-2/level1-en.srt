[SINGING]

2
00:00:00,145 --> 00:00:03,100
Your client side JavaScript
is starting to mold.

3
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,560
It's starting to resemble
a bad spaghetti code.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,470
And it is time to
add structure.

5
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,160
But it won't take too long.

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,590
Gotta get your truth
out of the DOM.

7
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,960
Take your data into models.

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,080
And you cannot lose.

9
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,290
We'll render out your models
with the help of the views.

10
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,415
And if you don't want your
JavaScript to end up like a

11
00:00:23,415 --> 00:00:25,170
mess, it's time for
the anatomy of

12
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,862
Backbone.js at Code School.

13
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,490
I'm Gregg Pollack.

14
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,660
And you're watching the Anatomy
of Backbone, Part Two.

15
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,880
In this first level,
we're going to be

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,460
going into more models.

17
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,740
So just to review,
we're getting our

18
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,900
truth out of the DOM.

19
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,460
Backbone provides the client
side application

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,190
structure for our app.

21
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,610
We have models that represent
data, views that

22
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,000
hook up to the DOM.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,640
And then Backbone also takes
care of synchronizing the data

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,830
back and forth from
the server.

25
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,390
Jumping back into our Backbone
app that we've been creating,

26
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,710
here is our TodoItem,
which is a model.

27
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,420
And then we give
it a urlRoot.

28
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,550
And we're assuming that that
attaches to a Rails RESTful

29
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:11,020
endpoint, the Rails Flavor of an
API, which our application

30
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,920
isn't always going to have that
standard API, which we're

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,980
actually going to cover
in this level.

32
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,540
How do we deal with that?

33
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,400
So then to get the
TodoItem with ID equals

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,140
1, we run this code.

35
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,590
And then we call fetch, which
fetches this JSON data, stores

36
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,090
that inside of our model.

37
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,720
But what if when we call fetch,
our API is different

38
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,060
than the standard Rails
interface, and it's sending

39
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,320
back something that
looks like this?

40
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,160
Well inside of Backbone,
there's a parse method.

41
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,990
This is what it looks
like by default.

42
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,040
We don't have to define it.

43
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,500
But this is what its behavior
looks like.

44
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,280
And with that default code, if
we call todoItem.attributes,

45
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,110
when we got this JSON array--

46
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,850
well, it would be empty.

47
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,920
So how do we deal with that?

48
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,160
To fix this and properly parse
the JSON, we are going to

49
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,050
define the parse method
inside of Backbone.

50
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:04,830
And inside there, we simply have
to write response.todo.

51
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,860
Instead of passing the response
directly through, we

52
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,440
intercept it in this method and
call .todo, so that the

53
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,910
proper JSON objects get
sent into Backbone.

54
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,050
Now we called that attributes,
we can see that our Backbone

55
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,100
model returns the
proper values.

56
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,960
What if instead of fetching the
JSON, we wanted to create

57
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,380
a model with some pre-existing
data like this?

58
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,180
But notice this is that weird
different format again.

59
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,890
In this case, if we call
.attributes, we can see that,

60
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,420
well, it didn't work.

61
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,410
It didn't properly go through
the parse method.

62
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,630
To fix this, we can add
another option to our

63
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,610
constructor--

64
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,940
in this case parse: true.

65
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,900
This will tell the model
to run the JSON

66
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,270
through the parse method.

67
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,830
And it will properly parse
the attributes.

68
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,340
But what if the API we're
working with sends back a

69
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,110
different property name?

70
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,410
You can see here that we
have d-e-s-c instead of

71
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,930
description, which is what
we're expecting.

72
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,800
To deal with this inside the
parse method, we can simply

73
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,390
define response.description
and set that equal to the

74
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,020
description that got sent
in from the JSON.

75
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,750
And we need to make sure
we delete the old

76
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,410
name for that property.

77
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,650
Then we just return
the response.

78
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,410
And now when we call
.attributes, we get back the

79
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,010
proper JSON object.

80
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,760
So we have our todoItem.

81
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,110
And if we update one of the
attributes and we call save,

82
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,480
that's going to call toJSON
and send that back to the

83
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,970
server using a put.

84
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,110
But the API we've been working
with is expecting the JSON in

85
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,720
that different format
we saw a minute ago.

86
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,170
So how do we modify that
JSON before we send

87
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,700
it back to the server?

88
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,620
We can fix this by overriding
the JSON method.

89
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,840
So here is the default behavior
of the JSON method.

90
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,170
And then here's the default
output, which in this case is

91
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,410
not what we want.

92
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,260
So to fix this, as you might
imagine, we just need to

93
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,360
override the toJSON method.

94
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,130
So here you can see we're simply
wrapping the attributes

95
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,470
inside a todo property.

96
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,535
This properly outputs what
our API is expecting.

97
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,709
But of course, we
forgot one part.

98
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,563
What about the description
becoming d-e-s-c?

99
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,970
To fix this inside of our JSON,
we can simply set the

100
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,060
d-e-s-c property.

101
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,560
And then we're going to use the
underscore library's pick

102
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,760
method, which allows us to send
in a JavaScript object

103
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,290
and pick out the properties
that we want to

104
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,580
be included in it.

105
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,800
So we'll have an object with
just the d-e-s-c and status

106
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,070
property, which then allows us
to create the proper object

107
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,320
that our API is expecting.

108
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,570
But there's a problem
with this though.

109
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,190
Now we can't use toJSON
in our view to

110
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,540
render out our template.

111
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,550
Well how would we fix this?

112
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,320
Here's the code inside of
our render function

113
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,960
where we call toJSON.

114
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,090
So we can't use to
JSON anymore.

115
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,400
To fix this instead of using
toJSON, we can use

116
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,340
model.attributes, which will
give us back the JavaScript

117
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,080
object we're looking for.

118
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,270
toJSON should only be used for
serializing the data back

119
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,260
to the server.

120
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,140
One more thing we might have
to deal with in an

121
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:31,250
unconventional API is a
non-standard ID attribute.

122
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,390
So here when we call fetch,
you can see that our ID

123
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,170
attribute is _id.

124
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:40,020
So if we try to parse this and
call .id on the model, we

125
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,410
would get back undefined.

126
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,900
To fix this, we simply need to
specify the ID attribute

127
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,960
property inside of our model.

128
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,280
Once we do that, it's going
to properly parse this

129
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,910
field as the ID.

130
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,110
That's the end of level one.

131
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,160
It's time for you to get your
hands dirty in the challenges.

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,151
