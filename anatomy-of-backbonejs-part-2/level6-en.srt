[SINGING]

2
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,100
Your client side JavaScript
is starting to mold.

3
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,550
It's starting to resemble
a bad spaghetti code.

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,140
And it is time to add
structure but it

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,170
won't take too long.

6
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,590
Gotta get your truth
out of the DOM.

7
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,080
Take your data into models that
you cannot lose, we'll

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,300
render out your models with
the help of the views.

9
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,120
And if you don't want your
JavaScript to end up like a

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,460
mess, it's time for
the Anatomy of

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:31,850
Backbone JS at Code School.

12
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,540
You're watching The Anatomy of
Backbone Part Two, and this is

13
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,650
Level Six where we're going
to be going over app

14
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,780
organization.

15
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,570
All of the Backbone objects
we've defined thus far have

16
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,810
been in the Global Namespace,
which can lead to problems.

17
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,110
First, it can lead to
naming collisions.

18
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,510
Second, we're having to put
the type of object it is

19
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,880
inside the name, which
just feels wrong.

20
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,340
And then lastly, the
maintainability of the app is

21
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,730
going to be difficult.

22
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,920
One way we could solve this
problem is by creating a

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,400
single global object where
we store everything.

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,370
So here you can see we've
got Models, Views, and

25
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:12,230
Collections, and then we
simply put our Backbone

26
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,870
objects inside of those.

27
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:18,460
So App.Models.ToDoItem,
App.Views, App.Collections,

28
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,620
App.Views, and we can just store
one off objects like our

29
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,940
router at the top level.

30
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,740
Now when we go to instantiate
these classes, we simply add

31
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,470
the Namespace, in this case
App.Models.ToDoItem.

32
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,500


33
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,910
Now let's talk about links.

34
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:38,370
We might have links in our
existing HTML that we want to

35
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,680
call Backbone actions.

36
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,000
So one way we could do this
is by using jQuery.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,020
So every time a link is
clicked, we'll prevent

38
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,730
default, and then we'll
navigate to the

39
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,920
target of that link.

40
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,060
However, what if we wanted
Backbone to handle

41
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,610
our links for us?

42
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,800
The first thing we can do to
make this cleaner is to move

43
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,410
this jQuery code inside of our
App Global Object, maybe

44
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,380
inside of a start function
like so.

45
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,750
This also might be
where we put our

46
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,840
Backbone.history.start function.

47
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,320
And to start our application, we
can simply call App.start.

48
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,030


49
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,490
However, the way we're listening
for events here is a

50
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:17,720
view concern.

51
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,100
Backbone is capable
of handling it.

52
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,160
So let's move this inside of
our View Event hierarchy.

53
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,500
To do this, we're going to make
our application itself a

54
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,020
Backbone View.

55
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,830
This allows us to use the
Backbone Events handler.

56
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,960
So inside here, we can
specify the event

57
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,860
when a link is clicked.

58
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,640
To instantiate the app, we're
going to send in the entire

59
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,490
document body so it will
listen for events

60
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,740
anywhere on the page.

61
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,410


62
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,150
Since we only want to create
one instance of this App

63
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,700
class, we can simplify this
code a little and actually

64
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,540
instantiate this view right
after we define

65
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,450
the class, like so.

66
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,580
Notice the parameters are now
at the bottom of this code.

67
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,680
Now to start our application
running, we simply need to

68
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,930
call App.start.

69
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:09,530


70
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,910
Here's our link HTML again, and
here's our Event Handler.

71
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,430
So this is going to capture
all links on the page.

72
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,440
But sometimes, we may not want
to capture all events.

73
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,305
For example, this Support link
here, that might be a link to

74
00:03:22,305 --> 00:03:24,720
a different web page that
doesn't use Backbone.

75
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,910
We might want to refresh
the entire page.

76
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,850
So how do we specify
which links we

77
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,560
want Backbone to handle?

78
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,790
One way we could do this is by
adding a data attribute.

79
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,960
So here we have
data-internal=true, and then

80
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,320
inside our Event Handler, we can
specify to only listen for

81
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,500
links that have this
data element.

82
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,920


83
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,440
Since we have a view that
encompasses our entire

84
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,690
document body, if we want, we
can put some template code

85
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:00,420
into this App View which has
some of our initial HTML.

86
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,950
This is why sometimes when you
go to websites that use

87
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,820
Backbone and you view the
source, there's not much HTML

88
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,700
on the page.

89
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,070
It's probably because it's
getting loaded initially by a

90
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,680
view that encompasses the
entire document body.

91
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,950
So to do that here, we have
a basic template.

92
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:22,240
We're going to render it, and
then call the Start function.

93
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,640
It renders out some initial
HTML to the body.

94
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,680


95
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,380
Inside of the start method
is also a good place to

96
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:36,170
instantiate our Collections,
our Views, render out our

97
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,270
Views and append that to
the page, and then

98
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,490
fetch the todoItems.

99
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,650
This works fine, but if you're
loading a page for the first

100
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,150
time, you're actually doing two
requests to load the page,

101
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,670
one to load the initial HTML,
and then you're doing an AJAX

102
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,780
request to fetch all the data.

103
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,740
But what if you could put
that initial data

104
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,830
also inside your HTML?

105
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,110
That would be quicker, and you
wouldn't have to do that

106
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,680
callback for all of your data.

107
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,350
The first step to do something
like that is to simply put

108
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,910
your data inside of a variable
inside of the HTML that we're

109
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,300
initially sending over.

110
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,920
In this case, we have
a little bootstrap

111
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,700
variable with our data.

112
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,010
We're going to send that
bootstrap variable into our

113
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,360
start function.

114
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,940
The start function receives a
bootstrap parameter, and then

115
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,715
we send that into our Collection
to initialize all

116
00:05:21,715 --> 00:05:22,965
of our todoItems.

117
00:05:22,965 --> 00:05:25,630


118
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,770
That's all there is to it, and
we've sped up our application

119
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,691
because it no longer has to do
that AJAX request to fetch all

120
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:35,020
the To Dos after the
page is loaded.

121
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,970
Let's have you organize some of
our Backbone code, and I'll

122
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,220
see you in the final level.

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,508
