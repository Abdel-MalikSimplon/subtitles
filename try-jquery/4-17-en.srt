1
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,880
Here's the page we're going to
be working with for our last

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,030
section here.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,940
As you can see, we have multiple
vacations, and when

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,160
we click Show Comments, we want
to show the comments for

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:12,990
that vacation.

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,930
Specifically, we want
them to fade in.

7
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,740
So how might we do that?

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,210
Here's our DOM, and the first
thing we want to do is to make

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,710
sure that the comments UL is
hidden when we load the page.

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,970
So we make it display none
inside of our CSS.

11
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,700
Then we want to add behavior
so that when we click this

12
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,470
link, show comments, that it
shows the proper comments

13
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,390
underneath that link.

14
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,560
Inside of our application.js
we have

15
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,800
our document ready.

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,370
Inside that, we're going to
fetch a vacation class, listen

17
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,670
for our click event on the link,
which has the expand

18
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,700
class on it, and then run
our event handler.

19
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,040
There's two things we
need to do inside

20
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,240
of our event handler.

21
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,580
First, we need to find the
comments UL, which is below

22
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,980
our link, and then, we need
to show it, in this

23
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,180
case, fade it in.

24
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,280
To find the appropriate comments
list, we need to do

25
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,710
some traversal, like we did
on previous sections.

26
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,860
So the link that was clicked,
we're going to start with

27
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,810
that, or in this case,
this, because it

28
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,850
was what was clicked.

29
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,080
And then call closest to
search up through its

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,120
ancestors to find the vacation
class, and then call find to

31
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,760
search down through the
DOM to find the

32
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,770
appropriate comments list.

33
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,170
So we found the comments list,
now we just need to fade it

34
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,460
in, and there's a couple
different fade

35
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,000
methods that we can use.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,110
We have fadeIn, fadeOut, and
fadeToggle, which will toggle

37
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,220
between the two.

38
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,750
In this case, we want to use
fadeToggle so that when we

39
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,380
click on the link, it'll
either fade them in

40
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,280
or fade them out.

41
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,190
So let's see this in action.

42
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,450
As you can see, we can click on
one of the links, and then

43
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,180
it fades in the comments.

44
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,770
And we can click on it
again, and it will

45
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,050
fade out the comments.

46
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,730
However, if we click on a link
near the bottom of the page--

47
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,070
did you see that?

48
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,400
The page jumped back up to
the top of the page.

49
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,150
That's kind of annoying,
and how do we fix that?

50
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,710
In order to understand how we
fix that, we need to grasp

51
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,020
what's happening when
the event occurs

52
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,440
inside of the DOM.

53
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,990
So here's our link, and when an
event occurs, we get this

54
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,445
little event bubble.

55
00:02:22,445 --> 00:02:23,910
We'll call it a bubble.

56
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,980
And it's going to start right
there on our link, and then

57
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,940
it's going to go up to each
parent node to let it know,

58
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,640
hey, a click event happened.

59
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,210
Eventually, it's going to get
to the top, and then, well,

60
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,950
because we have an href here
with a hash, it's going to

61
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,380
follow that link when it gets
up to the browser, which is

62
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,220
going to do the default
behavior, which is pop it back

63
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,320
up to the top of the page.

64
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,170
So we need to figure out a way
from preventing that default

65
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,420
browser behavior.

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,900
The first step down the road to
fixing this is to add the

67
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,330
event parameter inside
of our event

68
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,560
handler, as you see here.

69
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,210
We're going to need
that in a minute.

70
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,860
One way we can try to fix this
is by using stopPropagation.

71
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,030
What that's going to do is when
the event happens and it

72
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,100
tries to bubble up,
it's not going to.

73
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,970
It's not going to bubble
up to other ancestors.

74
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,140
However, stopPropagation does
not prevent the default

75
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,850
behavior from the browser, and
we're still going to pop up to

76
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:26,900
the top of the page.

77
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,430
So this is not our solution.

78
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,850
Instead, we're going to call
event.preventDefault to

79
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,340
prevent the default
behavior of

80
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,380
the browser- in this case, when
the event happens, it's going

81
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,590
to bubble up and when it reaches
our browser, it's not

82
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,850
going to follow the default
behavior, which is popping up

83
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,500
to the top of the page because
our href was a hash.

84
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,960
So now, when we go back to our
web page, we can see that we

85
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,970
can fade in comments and fade
out comments, and we're no

86
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,610
longer popping up to the
top of the web page.

87
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,070
So now, it's time for you to get
into the challenges, and

88
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,320
I'll see you in level five.
