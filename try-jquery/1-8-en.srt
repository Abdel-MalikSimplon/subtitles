1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560


2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:02,980
Good job.

3
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,680
So you've written some
of your first jQuery.

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,000
And you might be wondering,
how do I get

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,280
jQuery onto my web pages?

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,270
Well, first step is to go to
the jQuery.com webpage,

7
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,760
download jQuery.

8
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,370
You can load it into your HTML
page, using this script tag

9
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,050
you see here.

10
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,460
But in order to start using it,
you're probably going to

11
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,420
want to create another file,
maybe called application.js.

12
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,690
Include that inside your HTML.

13
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,049
And then inside your
application.js, meaning

14
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:33,960
JavaScript, you can
start writing your

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,210
jQuery right there.

16
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,970


17
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,460
In this section, let's look at
a few more ways we can find

18
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,420
elements in the DOM.

19
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,280
So here's some new HTML.

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,460
You can see, it has a UL, or
unordered list, of different

21
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,160
travel destinations.

22
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,600
How might we change the text of
every li on this web page?

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,740
Well, first we need to
find all of them.

24
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,220
And then we need to
modify their text.

25
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,290
Let's take a look at the
DOM on this webpage.

26
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,500
First, let's figure out what
the DOM looks like.

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,190
So there's our tree.

28
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,350
To select all these li's,
we don't need

29
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,350
three lines of code.

30
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,060
We just need one.

31
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,500
We just specify li,
just like that.

32
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,740
And it returns a jQuery object
of all of the li's.

33
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,030
If you want to change their text
nodes all to Orlando, we

34
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,550
simply send in the
string Orlando.

35
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,160
There we go.

36
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,350
If we're building a big webpage,
it's not unheard of

37
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,850
to have many different li's
inside many different lists

38
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,840
and many different paragraphs.

39
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,000
But we might not want
to select all of

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,240
them all of the time.

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,480
So how do we fix that?

42
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,440
Well, we can use many different
CSS selectors to

43
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,790
select particular parts
of the DOM.

44
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,960
So just like we were able to
select p, to select all of the

45
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,340
paragraphs, in CSS, if we wanted
to style an element

46
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,270
with the ID of container, in
jQuery we just specify

47
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,320
#container.

48
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,680
In CSS, to style an element with
the class of articles, we

49
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,120
just use .articles.

50
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,760
And in the same way in jQuery,
to fetch all of the elements

51
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,630
with the class of articles,
we simply put .articles.

52
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,750


53
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,830
So let's jump back into our
HTML and figure out how we

54
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,620
might select that unordered
list with the ID of

55
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,810
destinations.

56
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,640
Let's find it using the ID.

57
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,990
All we have to do, in this
case, is specify

58
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,620
#destinations.

59
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,390
And that will select the element
that has that ID.

60
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,230
Notice here, one of our li's
now has a promo class.

61
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,660
How might we select
just that class,

62
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,070
using the proper selector?

63
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:43,430
In this case, we would
just specify .promo.

64
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,910
And that would select all the
list elements that have the

65
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,070
class of promo.

66
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,080
In this case, there's
just one.

67
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,920
Why don't you try your hand at
using some specific selectors.

68
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,170
And I'll see you in level two.
