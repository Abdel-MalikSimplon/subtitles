1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,912


2
00:00:01,912 --> 00:00:04,870
So back in our demo, in our
vacation packages, you can see

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,950
we click on each button and it
gives us a price, but all the

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,890
vacations always have
the same price.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,050
How might we give them
different prices?

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,420
Well, here's one way
we could do it.

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,260
Here's our HTML, and we're going
to specify the price by

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,880
adding a data price attribute
to the HTML.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,510
The data tag is an HTML5
attribute you can add to any

10
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,650
of your elements to provide
additional information about

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,690
the objects on your page.

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,000
To interact with these
attributes, we can call data,

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,230
than specify a name to get out
the information, and we can

14
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,470
also set these attributes by
providing a name and a value.

15
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,200
Here's an example of reading
out that data.

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,400
We can fetch the nodes with the
vacation class from the

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,160
dom, get the first one of those,
then call data and

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,750
specify the price name.

19
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:02,300
Now, it'll return the price
that we see here, $399.99.

20
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,730
Now, let's go back to our old
code and refactor it to use

21
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,130
this data price attribute.

22
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,610
To do this, we're going to start
with a button that was

23
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,030
clicked, which is represented
here by this, we're going to

24
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,240
find the closest ancestor,
which has the

25
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,250
.vacation class.

26
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,800
And then, finally, call the data
method to get the price

27
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,160
value out of the dom.

28
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,440
We can then use that amount
when we construct our

29
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,910
paragraph dom node, which shows
the price, like so.

30
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:33,490


31
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:37,220
Let's take these two lines and
put them inside of our code.

32
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,380
So each vacation now, will
have its own price.

33
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,910
However, there's some
duplication

34
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,570
that's going on here.

35
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,450
You can see that we're fetching
the vacation class

36
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,870
here and then again
down below.

37
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,970
So let's eliminate
this duplication.

38
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,090
We can do this by creating a new
variable called vacation,

39
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,350
which will fetch us the closest
vacation, and then we

40
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,310
set the amount, we can simply
call that variable dot data,

41
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,540
and then when we append, we
can, of course, use that

42
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,790
variable again.

43
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,520


44
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,860
Now, if we use this code inside
of our function, no

45
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,180
longer are we repeating
ourselves, and we're only

46
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,380
querying the dom once for this
element, which is going to

47
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,630
make it a little bit faster.

48
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,460


49
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,980
Now, if we jump back into our
browser, when we click Get

50
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,860
Price, we see that each of our
vacations has its own price.

51
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,240


52
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,290
This works great, but what if
we start adding different

53
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,600
buttons to our web page?

54
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,810
This click handler is going to
be called for all of them, so

55
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,990
we need to make this
more specific.

56
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,710
Well, we could use
a CSS selector.

57
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,830
We could say dot vacation
button, so it's only going to

58
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,990
listen for click events
on buttons inside of

59
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,140
our vacation class.

60
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,300
But there's a better way to
write this, we can simply

61
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,970
fetch the nodes that have the
vacation class and then call

62
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,440
on, we want to listen for click
events, and then we'll

63
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,770
specify which elements inside
the vacation class we want to

64
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,670
listen for.

65
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:11,220
In this case, button elements,
and then our third argument

66
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,540
becomes our event handler
function.

67
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,740
This technique is called
event delegation.

68
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,230
We're only targeting
buttons if it's

69
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,555
inside a vacation class.

70
00:03:21,555 --> 00:03:24,460


71
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,610
So now, if we jump back
into our browser, our

72
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,300
buttons still work.

73
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,120
Sweet.

74
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,595
But, oh, we've got some filters
up there, On Sale Now

75
00:03:32,595 --> 00:03:34,530
and Expiring Soon.

76
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,060
Let's make those filters work.

77
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,570
Here's the HTML for
the filters,

78
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,280
they're inside of a div.

79
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,970
They're buttons as well, so we
want to make it so that when

80
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,120
we click On Sale Now, it only
shows On Sale vacations and

81
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,150
when we click Expiring it only
shows expiring vacations.

82
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,140
So to do this, we're going to
write two different event

83
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,470
handlers for the buttons, and
we'll highlight vacations with

84
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,130
these traits.

85
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,740
Here we are inside of our
application.js.

86
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,850
First, we're going to fetch the
div with the filters ID,

87
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,430
then we're going to use event
delegation to listen for click

88
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,600
events for the on-sale
filter class.

89
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,980
And inside of the event handler,
we're going to first

90
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,060
find all vacations that are on
sale, and then we're going to

91
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,340
add a class to these vacations
so they highlight.

92
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,370
Here's the dom for our
vacation list.

93
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,030
You can see that some of them
have two classes, vacation and

94
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,070
on sale, and some of them just
have one, being vacation.

95
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,600
So how might we select the ones
that are just on sale?

96
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,740
Well, we can do this using
a CSS selector.

97
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,090
We could just do dot vacation
dot on sale, however, let's do

98
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:47,210
this using traversing, so we'll
call dot vacation, and

99
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,920
then we'll filter those
vacations to return just the

100
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,985
ones that have the
on sale class.

101
00:04:53,985 --> 00:04:57,320


102
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,750
Let's move this code up
into our function.

103
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,380
And now, the second step, we
need to add a class on to

104
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,120
these vacations.

105
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,590
To add a class using
jQuery, we can use

106
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,470
the addClass method.

107
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,060
Similarly, we can use
the removeClass

108
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,830
method to remove a class.

109
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,590
So first, we'll grab all of the
vacations which have the

110
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:21,090
class vacation and on sale,
and we'll add the class of

111
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:25,210
highlighted onto all of them.

112
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,520
So let's move this back up
into our code, and as we

113
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,790
mentioned, filter finds the
right vacations and addClass

114
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,510
adds the highlighted class to
all of those vacations.

115
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,300
We can do the same thing for our
expiring filter, listening

116
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,940
for clicks on that expiring
filter button.

117
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,480
Then when it's clicked, we will
filter all the vacations,

118
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,580
which also have the expiring
class, and add the class of

119
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,450
highlighted.

120
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,110
Let's take a look at
this in action.

121
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,680
We click on two and we can see
them highlighting, but, well,

122
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,410
everything's highlighted now, so
if we continue to click the

123
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,200
buttons, nothing more happens.

124
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,620
So we need a way to unhighlight

125
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,810
all of these vacations.

126
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,000
One way we can do this is when
a button is clicked, first

127
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,450
thing, we'll look for any
highlighted classes, and we'll

128
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,300
remove that class of highlighted
from them.

129
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,850
So we're getting rid of all
highlighted classes from our

130
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,210
page before we then go and
add highlighted back

131
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,660
to the proper vacations.

132
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,400


133
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,760
So here we go, back on the page,
and now when we click

134
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,840
through our On Sale and Expiring
Now vacations, the

135
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,150
proper ones are highlighted.

136
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:36,250


137
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,980
You've reached the end
of level three.

138
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,390
Time to go to the challenges,
and I'll see

139
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,640
you in level four.
