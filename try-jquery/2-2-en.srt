extensibility.

7
00:00:21,365 --> 00:00:25,130
JQuery is something
you can't ignore.

8
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,926
Write less, do more.

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,760
I'm Greg Pollack, and you're
watching Try jQuery, And this

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,640
is level two, where we're going
to be searching through

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,170
the DOM using more
CSS selectors.

12
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,960
So here's the HTML we used
in our previous level.

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,580
And remember, we were able to
select the unordered list with

14
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,780
the ID of destinations.

15
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,960
But how might we select the
list items inside of that

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,170
specific unordered list?

17
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,790
We can do that using the
descendant selector.

18
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,970
So here is our DOM again.

19
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:05,069
And we can simply write
"#destinations li" to

20
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,940
select all the list items
underneath the element with

21
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,640
the destinations ID.

22
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,850
So here the parent is
destinations, and the

23
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,680
descendant is the LI.

24
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,830
Let's make our HTML a little
bit more complex.

25
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,110
As you can see here, now we have
an unordered list inside

26
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,860
of our unordered list.

27
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,400
And we want to find only the LI
elements that are children

28
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,500
of the destinations UL.

29
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,100
Just the children, not the
children's children.

30
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,520
To solve this, would we use
the descendant selector?

31
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,340
Well, let's see what
happens if we do.

32
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,030
If you use #destination li
like before, it

33
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,280
selects all of the list items
underneath that UL, which is

34
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,610
not what we want.

35
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,040
In order to find only the direct
children, we need to

36
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,440
use the child selector.

37
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,070
Let's see what that
looks like.

38
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,850
To select the direct
descendants, we specify

39
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,590
#destinations, then we
use the greater than

40
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,130
sign, and then LI.

41
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,070
You'll see in the DOM that that
Paris list item does not

42
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,610
get selected, because we're only
going after the direct

43
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,100
descendants.

44
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,070
#destinations is
the parent here.

45
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:23,250
The child here is LI, and that
greater than sign is what

46
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,330
tells jQuery that we're
looking for the direct

47
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,580
descendant.

48
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,800
Now, what if we want to select
multiple elements?

49
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,380
Let's say we want to select
elements with either a promo

50
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,480
class or a France ID.

51
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,640
To do that, we can simply list
".promo, #france"

52
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,560
Using a common like
this allows us to

53
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,895
select multiple items.

54
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,960
Now, what if we only wanted to
select the first item in that

55
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,520
unordered list?

56
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,530
We can do that using the
pseudo selector.

57
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,700
In this case
#destinations li:first

58
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,390
This will select the first
item in the list.

59
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,940
As you might imagine, to select
the last item in the list

60
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,720
we simply use
li:last.

61
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,130
If we wanted to select every
other list item, we might want

62
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,700
to use the odd pseudo class.

63
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,615
So in this case, it would only
select the middle list item.

64
00:03:23,615 --> 00:03:26,410
This might not seem intuitive
at first, but you have to

65
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,000
understand that the index for
these list items starts at

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,520
zero, like so.

67
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,640
So that's why the odd only
selects the middle item.

68
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:43,170
If we used even, it would select
0, 2, 4, 6, and so on.

69
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,150
Time for you to use some of
these selectors in the

70
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,400
challenges.
