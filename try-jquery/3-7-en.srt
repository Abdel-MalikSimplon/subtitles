1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250


2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,910
Now that you know how to remove
and add DOM nodes to

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,460
the page, let's take a look
at how we do interaction.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,670
Here's the code that we
use to listen for when

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,950
the document is ready.

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,590
Inside there we pass in
an Event Handler.

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,510
That Event Handler
is a function,

8
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,700
which looks like this.

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,460
And we send in all of the code
that we want executed inside

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,920
of that function.

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,050
Put them both together, and you
get the code that we're

12
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,245
now familiar with.

13
00:00:30,245 --> 00:00:33,670
The ready method takes one
argument, which is that Event

14
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,770
Handler function.

15
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,800
Now it's time to figure out how
to make that button work

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,080
so that when we click Get Price,
it shows us the price

17
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,330
of that vacation.

18
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,390


19
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,100
Here's the DOM for our page.

20
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,180
To listen for an event on the
button, we first need to get

21
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,260
the button out of the DOM.

22
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,180
We're going to want to use the
On jQuery Object method.

23
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,490
It takes an event and
an Event Handler.

24
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,250
So here we're going
to say On, Click.

25
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:08,090
And then our second parameter
is an Event Handler.

26
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,770
So this code is going
to return all the

27
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,300
buttons from the DOM.

28
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,630
We call the On method sending
in the Click as the first

29
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,440
argument, which we'll watch for
any clicks that happen to

30
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,780
any of those buttons.

31
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,420
And then when they're clicked,
it's going to run the code

32
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,670
inside of our function.

33
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,220


34
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,965
Let's take that code and
move it inside of

35
00:01:26,965 --> 00:01:28,160
our Document Ready.

36
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,810
So our function inside of our
Document Ready runs when the

37
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,060
DOM is ready.

38
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,690
And then our code inside of our
Click Handler runs when a

39
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,860
button is clicked.

40
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,740
Now all we need to do is
add in the code from

41
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,910
our previous section.

42
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,830
And now every time the button is
clicked, it's going to add

43
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:51,200
the paragraph and then remove
the button, as it should.

44
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,740
So let's go ahead and
see that in action.

45
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,040
When we click the Get Price
button, it first adds the

46
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,420
paragraph with the price
and then removes

47
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,290
the Get Price button.

48
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,080
Why don't you try making some
buttons work in the

49
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,330
challenges.
