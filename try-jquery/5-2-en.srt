00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,580
jQuery will help you build your
dot-com, find an element

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:11,430
inside of the DOM, AJAX
traversal manipulation, event

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,970
handling, and animation,
providing you with

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:21,650
versatility, an API with
extensibility.

6
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,130
jQuery is something
you can't ignore.

7
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,540
Write less.

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,790
Do more.

9
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,530
You're watching Try jQuery, and
this is level five, where

10
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,580
we're going to start by talking
a little bit about

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,340
taming CSS.

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,840
So we've got HTML, we've got
CSS, and we've got

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,060
JavaScript.

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,030
And if we want to change the
style of something, what

15
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,110
should we use?

16
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,470
We can use both CSS
and JavaScript.

17
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,570
Let's try using some
JavaScript.

18
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,610
So here we've got a page
where we've got

19
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,420
different vacation packages.

20
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,290
Let's make it so when people
click on the li element, that

21
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:00,540
it changes the style.

22
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,990
So here we are inside of our
application.js, and we're

23
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,180
listening for click events
on the vacation class.

24
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,380
There's a few different methods
we can use to get and

25
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,110
set the CSS.

26
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,460
We can set it by specifying
the attribute and a value.

27
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,250
We can get its current value by
specifying the attribute,

28
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,510
and we can also send
in an object.

29
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,660
Let me show you what
that looks like.

30
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,540
In our example, we could set the
background color for this

31
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,910
current li to this hex code.

32
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:38,680
We could also set the border
color to one pixel solid with

33
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,810
this color.

34
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,710
We could also do this in one
line by method chaining these

35
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,680
both together like so.

36
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,890
However, the cleanest way to do
it would be to simply send

37
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,200
in a JavaScript object, in this
case, having a series of

38
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,480
keys and values with just
one argument, which

39
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,730
is that JavaScript object.

40
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,160
Now when our vacations are
clicked, we want to show the

41
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,890
price for that vacation.

42
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,100
So we're going to take this,
which is the current li that

43
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,080
was clicked.

44
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,350
And we're going to find inside
of it the price class.

45
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,390
And then we want
to display it.

46
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,570
One way we can get it to display
is changing it from

47
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,060
display none to display block.

48
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,020
However there's a better
way to do that.

49
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,230
jQuery gives you two methods,
one called show

50
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,640
and one called hide.

51
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,810
And they basically do the same
thing-- they change it between

52
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,540
display none and
display block.

53
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,130
But they're a little
bit easier to use.

54
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,970
So here we call the show method,
and it's going to

55
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,320
display the price for us.

56
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,230
And there we go.

57
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,460
Now when we click on the li,
it highlights a vacation

58
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,960
package and shows the price,
as we can see here.

59
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,130
This might feel a little
bit dirty to you.

60
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,940
That might be a good feeling.

61
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,270
Because you might want to keep
all of your styles inside of

62
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,840
your style sheet and not
in your JavaScript.

63
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,730
So how might we do that here?

64
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,280
Let's refactor this
code to do that.

65
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,520
So let's create two
new classes.

66
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,550
We have a style on the
highlighted class and a style

67
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,290
on the price inside the
highlighted class.

68
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,920
Now in order to make these style
changes, all we have to

69
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,340
do is add this class
to our li.

70
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,670
So let's go ahead and
do that, and now our

71
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,770
code is a lot cleaner.

72
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,830
Plus, it's much easier to
manipulate the style, because

73
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,860
all of our styles are in CSS.

74
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,820
One more feature we want to add
here is when we click on

75
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,530
the li for the second time, we
want the price to go away.

76
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,480
So how do we remove the
highlighted class?

77
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,690
Well remember, not only do we
have .addClass() or

78
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:51,150
.removeClass(), but we can
also do .toggleClass().

79
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,750
So let's go ahead and do that.

80
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,540
We'll add .toggleClass()
highlighted.

81
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,830
And then it will add the class
if it doesn't have it.

82
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,710
And if it does, it will
properly take it away.

83
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,230
And here we are back in
our web page, and as

84
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,315
you can see, it works.

85
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,883
Time to get in the challenges,
and I'll see

86
00:04:11,883 --> 00:04:13,133
you in the next section.

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:16,599
