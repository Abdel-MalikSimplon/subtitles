1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:01,680
My name is Caike Souza,

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,270
and you're watching
Ruby Bits.

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:27,750
[MUSIC]

4
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,600
In this level, we're going to
take another look at classes.

5
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,650
As you may know, classes are
all about encapsulation, so

6
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,170
let's take a look at this
send_tweet method that takes

7
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,360
two arguments.

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,200
The second argument is the
owner_id, which is used by the

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,600
method to retrieve the user.

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,420
However, the send_tweet method
shouldn't really know how to

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,450
retrieve a user.

12
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,400
It knows too much.

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,270
A couple things to keep in mind
is that passing around

14
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,080
data as strings and numbers kind
of breaks encapsulation.

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,630
Places using that data need to
know exactly what to do with

16
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:03,350
it, and individual changes to
that behavior may influence

17
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,100
other areas of your code that
might be using that.

18
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,950
So one way to make this better
is to simply wrap all of that

19
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:10,990
in a class.

20
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,920
So you can see here, we've
created a tweet class with a

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,060
couple of attribute
accessors, and we

22
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,740
created the owner method.

23
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,770
So now, instead of passing data
to the send_tweet method,

24
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:26,520
we pass a tweet object, and the
tweet object knows how to

25
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,770
retrieve its owner.

26
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,330
Classes are not always
the solution.

27
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,140
When all you're dealing with is
data, then passing around

28
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,240
an options hash should suffice,
so let's take a look

29
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,080
at the user class that
has two methods.

30
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,310
In Ruby, if you don't say
otherwise, all the methods in

31
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,500
your class are going
to be public.

32
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,820
However, in this case, we only
want the up_vote to be

33
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,300
accessible from outside
of the class.

34
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:58,370
The bump_karma should not be
part of the public API.

35
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,810
One way to hide this method from
outside the class is to

36
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,150
declare it private.

37
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,620
Inside the up_vote method, the
first call to bump_karma works

38
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,950
as expected.

39
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,210
The second call,
friend.bump_karma, will error

40
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,550
out, and this is because private
methods in Ruby cannot

41
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,820
be called with an explicit
receiver.

42
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,330
The correct solution here is to
use protected, which will

43
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,240
prevent the method from being
called from outside the class,

44
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,790
but at the same time, it allows
the method from being

45
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,580
called with an explicit
receiver, which needs to be an

46
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,080
object from the same class that
the method belongs to.

47
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,690
Now, let's take a look
at these two classes

48
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,130
for image and video.

49
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,060
As you may notice, they both
have the same attribute

50
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,020
accessor for title,
size, and url.

51
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,050
This is called duplication, and
it's definitely not cool.

52
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,580
So let's get our duplicate code
and move into a Parent

53
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,700
class, which we'll call
attachment, and both image and

54
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,410
video will inherit from that.

55
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,540
We say that image and video
are both kind of an

56
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,350
attachment, so in the future, if
we have any custom behavior

57
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,530
for any of these subclasses, we
can simply write the code

58
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,980
on the specific subclass.

59
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,820
Let's take a look at
some more code.

60
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,560
Here, we have a user class,
whose constructor initializes

61
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,390
the name property, and a
Follower class, which is a

62
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,200
kind of user, and its
constructor initializes the

63
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,620
following property.

64
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,780
If we instantiate an object from
the Follower class and

65
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,480
call the relationship method,
we'll notice that the name

66
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,750
property was not set.

67
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,640
This is because the constructor
for the Parent

68
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,420
class is not being called.

69
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,670
If we want to do so, then
we use the super method.

70
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,040
If we want to set the name
property in this case, we can

71
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,460
just call super, which will look
for a method by the same

72
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,890
name on one of the Parent
classes, in this case user.

73
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,880
So you might be wondering how
is super able to find the

74
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,750
correct method in the Parent
class, so let's look at a more

75
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,400
complex example.

76
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,840
Here, we have a Grandparent
class that declares my_method,

77
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,680
then we have a Parent class
that inherits from

78
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,400
Grandparent, doesn't
declare any method.

79
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,560
Then we have a Child class that
is a subclass of Parent,

80
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,430
and it's got its own my_method
declaration.

81
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,770
When we call my_method
on a Child object, it

82
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,550
first invokes super.

83
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,910
What super does is look at the
Parent classes to find methods

84
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,190
with the same name.

85
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,600
First, it's going to look
in the Parent class.

86
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,530
It doesn't find it, then it
looks at the Parent class's

87
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,290
superclass, which
is Grandparent.

88
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,570
Grandparent happens to have a
my_method declaration, so it's

89
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,930
going invoke that, then it's
going to print the string

90
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,775
my_method call in
the Child class.

91
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,040
So what if both my_methods
took arguments?

92
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,650
You can see here, my_method on
the Grandparent takes an

93
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,140
argument, and my_method on the
Child takes an argument.

94
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,820
However, we're calling super
with no arguments.

95
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,720
It so happens that in Ruby, if
you called super with no

96
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,190
arguments or params, it will
automatically pass in the

97
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:03,020
arguments that were passed
to the method calling it.

98
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,930
Now, let's look at the
attachment class with a

99
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,450
preview method and a case
statement in it.

100
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,450
The case statement is checking
for the type of attachment.

101
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,020
If it's an image, then
it's going to call

102
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,280
the thumbnail method.

103
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,840
Otherwise, if it's an MP3, then
it's going to call the

104
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,990
player method.

105
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,220
In this case, being an image,
it's kind of the typical case,

106
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,250
so what we can do is make this
the default behavior for the

107
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,050
attachment class and override
this method in any class that

108
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,950
happens to behave differently.

109
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:33,150
If speed is important to you,
this is actually faster

110
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,470
because every time we call the
preview method, we don't have

111
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,110
to go through the case
statement and the

112
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,130
comparisons in it.

113
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,100
Now, let's take a look at the
user class with two methods

114
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,340
that both have access to
the first and last

115
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,140
name instance variables.

116
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,530
There's some duplication going
on here, and coupling with

117
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,140
these two instance variables.

118
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,640
One way to make this better is
to create another method,

119
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,290
let's call it display_name,
which will return the value

120
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,800
used to display the
name of the user.

121
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,940
That way, if we ever need to
change the way we display the

122
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,050
name of the user, we only have
to worry about changing code

123
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,300
in one place.

124
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,370
Here, you can see we decided
to add the title to the

125
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,800
display name, and all we had to
do was change the code in

126
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,050
the display_name method.

127
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,110
You have now reached the
end of level three.

128
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,800
Start playing with the
challenges, and I'll

129
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,850
see you in a bit.

130
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,100
No pun intended.
