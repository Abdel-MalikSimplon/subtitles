1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,370
We're back with the second
CSS style section.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,029
Let's move on to talk about
multiple backgrounds.

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,230
CSS3 gives us the ability to
specify multiple backgrounds

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,730
on a particular element.

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,260
Those background images are
stacked in the order in which

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,000
you specify them.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,670
Let's look at an example here.

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,700
So I'm specifying my background
image and I'm

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,540
specifying two separate
background images.

10
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,490
So here we have the
first URL -

11
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,890
bg1.png -

12
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,300
and the second URL -

13
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,560
bg2.png.

14
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,070
We separate these two
with a comma.

15
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,770
Next, we specify the background
position for each

16
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,210
of those two images.

17
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,260
The first one is top left, then
we set a comma, and the

18
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,260
second one is center right.

19
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,010
Finally, we specify the
background repeat for each of

20
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,180
those two images.

21
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,660
Each of them are no repeat.

22
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,760
This is what our two background
images look like.

23
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,150
We have the first one on the
left, which again, is stacked

24
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,720
above the second one, because
it was specified first.

25
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,750
And then we have our second
background image on the right

26
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,900
at center bottom.

27
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,340
You can also specify multiple
backgrounds using the

28
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,960
shorthand background property
doing this all on one line.

29
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,310
So here we're specifying the
URL, the background position,

30
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,850
and the background repeat for
the first image with a comma.

31
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,430
Then we specify our second
background image with a

32
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,020
background position and the
background repeat, and we get

33
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,900
the same output.

34
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,550
Moving right along, we have
the color property.

35
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,430
Now, CSS3 gives us
a few different

36
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,250
ways to specify colors.

37
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,560
We can use the RGBa function
or the HSLa function.

38
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,440
Let's look at each
of these in turn.

39
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,680
Now, RGB represents the three
additive primary colors red,

40
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,860
green, and blue.

41
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,370
But in CSS3, we additionally
get the "a" value, or alpha

42
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,650
value, which allows
us to specify the

43
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,582
opacity of a color.

44
00:01:47,582 --> 00:01:49,260
Let's look at a quick
example here.

45
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,460
We're specifying the color
property to have a 75% opaque

46
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,200
black color value.

47
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,160
We do this by specifying 0, 0, 0
as the RG&B values, and that

48
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,410
represents the color of black.

49
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,130
Then we specify the a value, or
alpha, to be 0.75, and that

50
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,680
is 75% opaque black.

51
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,570
Now, HSLa is different
than RGB.

52
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,590
HSL stands for hue, saturation,
and lightness.

53
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,310
And in addition to those three
values, we can also specify

54
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,340
the a value, which is the alpha
value to represent the

55
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,890
opacity of a color.

56
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,670
Let's look at an example
of the HSLa function.

57
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:32,250
So here we're specifying a 240
hue value, 100% saturation

58
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,490
value, a 50% lightness value,
and then, finally, that 0.75

59
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,260
alpha value -

60
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,260
so 75% of the color.

61
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,270
When choosing between HSLa and
RGBa, it's important to point

62
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,630
out that HSLa is generally
more intuitive than RGBa,

63
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,690
because it's easier to make
color adjustments on the fly.

64
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,110
However, use whichever color
utility you're most

65
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,220
comfortable with.

66
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,400
And if you want to learn more
about HSL and RGB, take our

67
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,510
Fundamentals of Design course.

68
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,010
Next up, we're going to talk
about the opacity property

69
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,800
specifically.

70
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,740
CSS3 allows you to specify the
opacity, or transparency, of

71
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,710
an element using the
opacity property.

72
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,140
So let's look at an example.

73
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,310
Here, we're specifying the
opacity property to be 0.45.

74
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:24,160
The 0.45 value here represents
a 45% opaque color value,

75
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,650
which is essentially just
affecting the transparency of

76
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,340
the element.

77
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,320
If we apply that 0.45 opacity
value to our image here, we

78
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,630
can see it gets an opacity
value of 45%.

79
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,680
Now, it's also important to
note that the opacity on a

80
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,840
given element affects the
elements nested inside of it.

81
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,580
Let's look at an example.

82
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,250
So let's say that I had this div
with a class of element on

83
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,060
it, and then an h2
inside of that.

84
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,510
If I was to specify a background
on that element and

85
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,230
then adjust the opacity value
setting at 0.45 value, like we

86
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:03,740
just did, it would affect both
the text and the image.

87
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:08,020
If I was to apply a background
and an opacity value of 0.45

88
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,130
on that element, it would affect
both the image and the

89
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,850
text, as seen here.

90
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,790
We'll wrap up this level
on CSS3 styles by

91
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,620
talking about gradients.

92
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,570
CSS3 gives us the ability to
create gradients, which are

93
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,370
smooth transitions between
two or more colors.

94
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,920
There are two main types
of gradients

95
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,520
that browsers support -

96
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,830
linear gradients and
radial radians.

97
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,280
We'll start by covering
linear gradients.

98
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,540
In order to create a linear
gradient, we specify the

99
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,980
starting point, the ending
point, and then

100
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,150
optional color stops.

101
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,670
Let's look at an example.

102
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,040
So here I'm specifying a
linear gradient on the

103
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,760
background property by using the
linear gradient function.

104
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,550
In that function, I'm passing
different values.

105
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,230
And the output of that
looks like this.

106
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,920
Let's examine how each
of these values work.

107
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,620
First, we're going to specify
the direction of the gradient

108
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,320
through either an angle
or a keyword.

109
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,960
Now, the angle is generally
going to be a degree, so

110
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,340
something like 45 degrees.

111
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:13,300
The key word is going to consist
of the word "to"

112
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,810
followed by a side-or-corner,
which also consists of two key

113
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,500
words: horizontal values of left
or right, and vertical

114
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,640
values of top or bottom.

115
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,110
Now, the last thing that we need
to specify for our linear

116
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,710
gradient are color stops.

117
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,780
We'll specify one or more color
stops that consist of a

118
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,570
color and an optional
stop-position, that can either

119
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,140
be a link or a percentage.

120
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,590
Going back to our initial linear
gradient example, you

121
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,690
can see that we're not setting
an angle value, but we are

122
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,030
specifying the side-or-corner
to be "to bottom", which is

123
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,830
going to make the gradient go
from the top to the bottom.

124
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,410
Now, how's it doing that?

125
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,370
Well, it's important to note
that the keywords "to top," "to

126
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,590
bottom", "to right", and "to
left" correspond to specific

127
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,790
degree values.

128
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,540
Those are 0 degrees,
180 degrees, 270

129
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,050
degrees, and 90 degrees.

130
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,250
So our keyword "to bottom" is
actually translated into 180

131
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,860
degrees, as seen here.

132
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,360
The first color stop we specify
is red, which is where

133
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,210
the top of the gradient
starts.

134
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,020
And then the second and last
color stop we specify is

135
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,385
yellow, and that's where
the gradient

136
00:06:18,385 --> 00:06:19,635
will end at the bottom.

137
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,660
Now, a radial gradient is
different than a linear

138
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,720
gradient, because it extends
from an origin, the center of

139
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,880
the element, and it extends
outward in either a circular

140
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,630
or elliptical shape.

141
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,440
A radial grading consists of
three different parts--

142
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,200
the center, the ending shape
contour and position, and,

143
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,900
finally, color stops - just
like we specified for the

144
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,620
linear gradient.

145
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,960
So now, let's look
at a real simple

146
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,760
example of a radial gradient.

147
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,400
So here, we're specifying two
color stops - aqua and blue -

148
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,650
and we can see what the
output looks like.

149
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,110
This creates a two-color
elliptical gradient that

150
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,345
extends outward from the
center of the element.

151
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,790
Now, let's look more in depth at
each of the values that we

152
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,970
can pass in to the radial
gradient function.

153
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,280
First, you specify the shape
or size of the gradient.

154
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,790
The shape of the gradient can
either be a circle or an

155
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:17,730
ellipsis. The default of
which is an ellipsis.

156
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,510
The size of the gradient
consists of keywords, and

157
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,790
those keywords are
"closest-side,"

158
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,230
"closest-corner,"
"farthest-side," and

159
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,560
"farthest-corner."

160
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,470
Now, "farthest-corner" here is
the default value, if we don't

161
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,950
pass one in.

162
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,570
Additionally, you can actually
change the size to be of

163
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,880
length or a percentage.

164
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,790
Next, we specify the position of
the radial gradient, using

165
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,460
the "at" keyword, followed
by the position.

166
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,020
The default for this is center,
but you can specify

167
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,550
any value you can use for the
background position property.

168
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,990
Finally, we specify one or
more color stops, which

169
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,310
again, consist of a color and
an optional stop-position,

170
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,430
which can either be a length
or a percentage.

171
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,110
So now, let's look at an example
of a radial gradient.

172
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:04,040
So here we're specifying a
radial gradient function on

173
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,590
the background property.

174
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,680
We first set the shape of the
gradient to be circle, rather

175
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,380
than ellipsis.

176
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,510
Next, we set the position of the
gradient to be top left,

177
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,490
so it's going to start
up at the top left.

178
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:20,310
Next, we specify the first color
stop, which is aqua, and

179
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,400
then we specify the last color
stop, which is blue.

180
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,710
Here, we can see the output
of that radial gradient.

181
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,750
We have a two-color circular
radial gradient that extends

182
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,460
outward from the top left.

183
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,039
That's it for Level Four.

184
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,690
You now know all the
new CSS3 styles.

185
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:41,260
Have fun using them
in the challenges.

186
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,175
[In the back] One pixels.

187
00:08:42,175 --> 00:08:43,710
Move it one pixels.

188
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,730
[INAUDIBLE] the limiges -

189
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:45,390
The limiges?

190
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,240
The limiges are located.

191
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,370
The color of the drop shadow,
in this case - zero.

192
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,580
The color zero.

193
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,830
Color zero.
