1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,220
Welcome back.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,590
Hope you had some success with
those Level Two challenges.

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:09,780
This is Level Three: HTML5 Forms.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,210
In this level, we're going to
talk about the new HTML5 input

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,360
types, the new form elements,
and then we're going to wrap

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,150
things up with the new
form attributes.

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,980
So let's start off by talking
about the new

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,780
input types in HTML5.

9
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,240
HTML5 provides several
new input types.

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,880
And we're going to look at
each of these in turn.

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,130
Now something that we just need
to be aware of is that if

12
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,170
a browser doesn't support a
particular input type, it

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,480
defaults to text.

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,780
First off, we're going to look
at the search input type,

15
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,020
which is just a control
for entering one

16
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,910
or more search terms.

17
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,580
We can see that we have
a search input

18
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,080
here at the top right.

19
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,040
Let's see how we can convert
this input from a text input

20
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,940
to a search input.

21
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,440
To use a search input type,
we simply change the type

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,800
attribute from text to search.

23
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,090
And you can see here that we're
not specifying a value,

24
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,780
so it's going to be an
empty search input.

25
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,190
Now when that's rendered, we see
that we get a search input

26
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,210
with rounded corners that we can
enter our search term into

27
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,230
and then clear it out with the
conveniently located x icon

28
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,030
off to the right.

29
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,340
Additionally, in mobile browsers
like here in mobile

30
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,460
Safari, we get some added
usability benefits.

31
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,140
The primary action button
changes to search, which

32
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,810
reinforces what the user
is currently doing.

33
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,935
Now let's look at
the email input.

34
00:01:27,935 --> 00:01:30,990
The email input looks just like
a regular text input, but

35
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,050
it also gives us added usability
on mobile devices.

36
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,790
Looking at our art gallery, we
can see that we have an email

37
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,320
input down here at
the bottom right.

38
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,470
Now don't worry about that
enter your email

39
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,750
text inside the input.

40
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:48,390
We'll look at that later and see
how we can spruce it up.

41
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,920
To use the email input type,
all we have to do is change

42
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,910
the type attribute from text
to email just like we did

43
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,070
before with search.

44
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,440
And again, on the mobile safari
keyboard we can see

45
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,560
that we now get useful email
related keys like the at

46
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,875
symbol and the period.

47
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,789
Next up, we have the URL input,
which again, looks just

48
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:11,900
like a regular text input, but
gives us some nice usability

49
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,990
on mobile devices.

50
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,140
Again, on the mobile Safari
keyboard, we can see that we

51
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,920
get useful URL related keys such
as the slash and .com.

52
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,060
Next up, we have the date
input type which is

53
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,850
essentially just a control that
lets you set a string

54
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,100
that represents a date.

55
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,360
To use the date input type, all
we have to do is change

56
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,780
the type attribute from text to
date, just as we did with

57
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,420
the other 
HTML5 input types.

58
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,170
Now, here we can see in the
browser that we get a date

59
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,980
picker when we click on the
arrow to the right side of the

60
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,180
input allowing us to
conveniently select a date.

61
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,470
And in mobile Safari, we get
the native iOS date picker.

62
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,340
Next up, we have
the tel input.

63
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,540
Now the tel input, again, like
some of the other input types

64
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,280
just looks like a regular text
input, but we do get some

65
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,430
added usability on
mobile devices.

66
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,050
To use the tel input type,
again, you just need to change

67
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,990
the type attribute
from text to tel.

68
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,950
Real simple.

69
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,410
And, again, here in mobile
Safari, the keyboard now

70
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:22,260
changes to be the telephone
keyboard on iOS.

71
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,140
Another input type
is the number.

72
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,880
Which essentially just let's
us set a string value that

73
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,870
represents a number.

74
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,390
To use the number input type,
we just change the type

75
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,750
attribute from text to number.

76
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,370
And then we can see here that we
get a convenient control to

77
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,170
the right side of the input that
allows us to increase or

78
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,035
decrease the value
in the input.

79
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,640
And in mobile Safari the
keyboard now changes so that

80
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,840
we have a row of number keys at
the top when we're focused

81
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,160
on a number input.

82
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,970
The range input type is
an imprecise control

83
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,770
for setting a number.

84
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,410
To use the range input type, we
change the type attribute

85
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,765
from text to range.

86
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,810
And then we can see that we get
a control that allows us

87
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,235
to drag a slider to change
the number value.

88
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,410
Taking a look at two similar
input types, the month and the

89
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,230
week, we specify them by
changing the type attribute

90
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:31,080
from text to month and
week, respectively.

91
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,240
We can see here on the left side
that we have the month

92
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,580
input type that allows us to
select a month at a time.

93
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,210
And then on the right, we have
the week input type to select

94
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,460
a given week.

95
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,760
Two more similar input types,
the time and date time local

96
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,670
are specified by changing the
type attribute to time and

97
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,660
datetime-local.

98
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,280
We can see here that on the left
we have a time input type

99
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,010
that allows you to select
a given time.

100
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,380
And then on the right, we have
a datetime-local input type

101
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,420
that not only allows you
to select the date,

102
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,670
but the time as well.

103
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,200
There's a clear distinction
between the datetime-local and

104
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,880
datetime input types.

105
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,580
Now the datetime-local input
type has no time zone

106
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,630
information associated
with it.

107
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,250
The final HTML5 input type we're
going to take a look at

108
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,490
is the color.

109
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,610
Now a color input type simply
lets us set a string that

110
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,510
represents a color.

111
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,900
To use the input type of color,
we simply change the

112
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,210
type attribute to be color.

113
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,770
And then we can see here that we
get a toggle that allows us

114
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,520
to bring up the color picker
to select a color.

115
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,190
Wow.

116
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,830
That's a lot of input types.

117
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,340
So now let's take a look
at some of the new

118
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,090
form elements in HTML5.

119
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,340
In HTML5, we get a few different
form elements

120
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,400
provided to us.

121
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,320
Those are the datalist element,
the keygen element,

122
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,860
and the output element.

123
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,350
Now we're just going to focus
on the datalist form element

124
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:08,410
because it's the most
commonly used one.

125
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,040
The datalist form element allows
you to set predefined

126
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,870
options that you can use
for other controls.

127
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,310
Let's take a look at
how we do this.

128
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,430
The first thing we need to do
is specify an input and here

129
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,640
we're just using a regular
text input.

130
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,780
But we're also adding a list
attribute of browsers.

131
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,130
Now, I'll get to how this
works in a second.

132
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,930
Let's look at how we specify
the datalist element.

133
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,560
So here we simply use the
datalist tag and then we're

134
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,340
specifying an ID of browsers.

135
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,370
The list and ID attributes need
to sync up so that the

136
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,920
input knows about the
datalist options.

137
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,810
The next thing we need to do is
specify each of our options

138
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:45,950
with values.

139
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,070
Now you'll recognize this
because these are the same

140
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,720
ones that we use within
a select tag.

141
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,570
And these are the option
values that will now be

142
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,825
available to our input.

143
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,510
Our input looks just like a
regular text input, but when

144
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,940
we start typing, we can see
that we get auto-complete

145
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,350
suggestions based on the
option values that we

146
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,700
specified within the
datalist element.

147
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,950
How cool is that?

148
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,300
And we'll wrap this level up by
talking about the new HTML5

149
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,280
form attributes.

150
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,010
HTML5 provides several
new form attributes.

151
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,500
Things like placeholder,
autofocus, autocomplete,

152
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,310
required, pattern, and several
others that are

153
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,240
available to us.

154
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,800
Now we're going to focus
primarily on the placeholder,

155
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,300
autofocus, required, and
pattern attributes.

156
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,650
The placeholder attribute
allows you to specify a

157
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,290
message that's shown
inside the input.

158
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,140
That message is hidden when
the user starts typing and

159
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:46,770
then it returns when focus
is lost on that input.

160
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,030
Looking at our art gallery site,
we can see that we have

161
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,570
this enter your email
placeholder text.

162
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,110
Now I referenced this earlier.

163
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,200
So I'm going to show you how
we can use the placeholder

164
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,460
attribute to spruce this up.

165
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,420
In order to do so, we need to
change the value attribute as

166
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,990
it's currently set to
be placeholder.

167
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:07,090
The advantage here is with the
value attribute there, the

168
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,930
user has to select that text and
clear it out before they

169
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,060
can start typing.

170
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,600
The placeholder attribute
actually makes it much nicer.

171
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,980
We can see on the rendered input
that we get slightly

172
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,770
grayed out text that's removed
when the user starts typing

173
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,670
and then returns again
when they remove the

174
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,920
text from the input.

175
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,750
Next up, we have the autofocus
attribute, which as the name

176
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,320
implies, automatically
focuses an input

177
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,340
when the page is rendered.

178
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,250
To use the autofocus attribute,
you just need to

179
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,010
add autofocus to the input
that you want to

180
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,049
automatically focus on.

181
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:44,010
When the page is rendered,
that input is now

182
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,610
automatically focused.

183
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,670
And this is something that we
had to previously do in

184
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,730
JavaScript.

185
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:53,930
Now in HTML5 we just need
to add one simple word.

186
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,950
A third attribute is the
required attribute.

187
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,990
When a form is submitted, the
user will be notified of an

188
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,040
error if the field
is left blank.

189
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,010
Let's see how we can use this.

190
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,750
Like the autofocus attribute,
all we have to do to use the

191
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,595
required attribute is add
that text to an input.

192
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,160
When the user submits the form,
if they leave that field

193
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,900
blank, they're given an error
message telling them that they

194
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,925
need to fill in that
required field.

195
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:26,180
Lastly, we have the pattern
attribute which accepts a

196
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,000
JavaScript regular expression
that will be matched against

197
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,090
the user's entry to ensure they
have the correct pattern.

198
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,600
Now let's look at an example
of how we'll

199
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,290
use the pattern attribute.

200
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,030
You might not be familiar
with JavaScript regular

201
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,030
expressions, but don't
worry about that.

202
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,660
We'll provide resources at
the end of the course.

203
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,930
For now, just know that we're
matching three digits.

204
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,730
When the form is submitted, if
the user's entry doesn't

205
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,800
exactly match the pattern,
they're notified of an error

206
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,735
until the pattern is matched.

207
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,840
That concludes level 3.

208
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,040
So now that you're a little more
comfortable with HTML5

209
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,270
forms, let's give you
some challenges.

210
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,271
And we'll see you
back in level 4.

211
00:10:08,271 --> 00:10:08,760
[BEEPING]

212
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,860
You like the dancing?

213
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,603
I did and I didn't
say this before.

214
00:10:11,603 --> 00:10:12,490
[LAUGHTER]

215
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,435
Wrong emphasis on the
wrong syllable.

216
00:10:16,435 --> 00:10:17,830
[LAUGHTER]

217
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,220
Not even close.
