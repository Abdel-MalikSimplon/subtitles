1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:02,880
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,600
Hope you enjoyed those
challenges.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,930
This is Level Two:
HTML5 Elements.

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,550
So in this level, we're covering
the new HTML5 section

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,350
elements, such as the section,
the header, the footer, the

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:19,720
aside, the nav, the article,
the main, the figure and

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,820
figcaption elements.

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,400
And then finally, we'll
wrap up by talking

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,650
about the time element.

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,890
In this level, we'll be using
this example art gallery site,

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,380
that you'll see repeatedly when
we talk about these new

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,740
HTML5 elements.

13
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,480
So let's start by talking about
the section element.

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,820
Now by definition, the section
element represents a generic

15
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,080
document or application
section.

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,490
Now I know what you're
thinking.

17
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,780
The definition for that sounds
a lot like the definition for

18
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,130
a div, which is just a generic
container that conveys no

19
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,520
particular meaning.

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,980
Now there's a very important
distinction between a

21
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,460
section and a div.

22
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,860
While a div has no semantic
meaning, a

23
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,300
section element does,

24
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,740
and it's used for grouping
together

25
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,305
thematically related content.

26
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,840
In the book, HTML5 For Web
Designers, Jeremy Keith tells

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,370
us, when we're trying to
determine between using divs

28
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,640
or section elements to ask
ourselves, "Is all of the

29
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,090
content related?"

30
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,500
If you answered yes to that
question, then a section

31
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,040
element might be appropriate.

32
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,000
Looking at our art gallery site,
we can see that we have

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,730
a grouping of thematically
related content that contains

34
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,150
a natural heading.

35
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,830
While all section elements
don't have to necessarily

36
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,000
contain a heading, they
generally do.

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,680
And in this instance,
ours does.

38
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,660
And it has the heading,
"The Gallery."

39
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,950
Now let's look at how
we'd mark this up.

40
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,600
Prior to HTML5, we would have
marked this up with a div,

41
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,050
with a class or ID of section,
and then the

42
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,430
markup contained within.

43
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,910
In HTML5, though, we can
instead use the section

44
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,760
element to wrap our markup,
which makes our document much

45
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,010
more semantic.

46
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,190
Now I briefly want to mention
the document outline, which is

47
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,940
what's used to produce an
outline summary of an HTML

48
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,735
document, based on the markup
that's used in that document.

49
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,520
A few of the HTML5 elements
have their own

50
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,009
self-contained outline.

51
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,900
And those elements are the
article element, the aside

52
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,820
element, the nav element,
and the section element.

53
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:21,180
Now let's look at an example of
this to see how it works.

54
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,670
In this example, we have an h1
here, that says, "This is the

55
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,310
title of the page." We have
a section element,

56
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,890
and inside that section element,
we have an h2 that

57
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,280
says, "This is the title
of a subsection."

58
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,900
The document outline for this
particular piece of markup

59
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,630
would look something
like this.

60
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,210
We have a first, main heading
for "This is the title of the

61
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,710
page," our h1.

62
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,740
And then we have the first main
subheading, which is,

63
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,240
"This is the title of a
subsection." Because the

64
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,870
document outline is actually
self-contained within this

65
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,950
section element, we can
instead replace the h2 in

66
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,470
this section with an h1,
and our document

67
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,980
outline remains the same.

68
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,810
Now that we talked about the
section element, let's move on

69
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,950
to talk about the
header element.

70
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,090
Now the header element is
defined as a group of

71
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,500
introductory or navigation
aids.

72
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,940
It's important to note that you
can include more than one

73
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,210
header on your page.

74
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,450
It's not just limited to the
top portion of your site.

75
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,470
While the header generally
appears at the top of a

76
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,280
document or section, it's
defined more by its content

77
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,320
rather than its position.

78
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,550
Looking at our sample art
gallery site, we can see at

79
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,010
the top that we have a section
that contains introductory

80
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,810
content, as well as
navigational aids.

81
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,990
This is a good use of
the header element.

82
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,560
Let's see how we'd
mark that up.

83
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,270
Prior to HTML5, we would have
marked this up with a div,

84
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,390
with a class or ID of
header, and then our

85
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,300
markup contained within.

86
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,200
In HTML5, though, we can
instead use the header

87
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,450
element, and then all of our
markup contained within that.

88
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,480
This makes our document
more semantic.

89
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,630
In other words, the meaning
of our HTML

90
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,200
document is more clear.

91
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,850
Now like I said before, you can
have header elements in

92
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,500
different parts of your page.

93
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,160
So here we're showing that we
have a header element inside

94
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,740
of a section element.

95
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,810
So this is the header for
this particular section.

96
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,850
So now that we talked about the
header element in HTML5,

97
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,630
let's move on to talk about the
footer element in HTML5.

98
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,660
By definition, the footer
element represents a footer

99
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,240
for its nearest ancestor
sectioning content, or

100
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,690
sectioning root element.

101
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,390
Now similar to the header,
the footer element is not

102
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,080
dependent on its position.

103
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,050
It needs to be describing
the content that

104
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,860
it's contained within.

105
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,210
Looking at our sample art
gallery site, we can see that

106
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,240
we have a footer for
entire site.

107
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,460
So now let's see how this
element is marked up.

108
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,120
Prior to HTML5, we'd mark this
up with a div, with a class or

109
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,500
ID of footer, and then
all of the markup

110
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,810
contained within that.

111
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,750
In HTML5, though, we can
instead use the footer

112
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,030
element to wrap all of our
markup, which again makes our

113
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,280
document more semantic.

114
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,990
Like the header, we can also
put the footer within other

115
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,720
HTML5 elements.

116
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,265
So notice how this is a footer
for this particular section.

117
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,336
Now let's talk about the
aside element in HTML5.

118
00:05:17,336 --> 00:05:21,030
The aside element was initially
defined by the HTML5

119
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,970
spec, as being tangentially
related to the content

120
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:24,970
surrounding it.

121
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,980
Now what in the world
does that mean?

122
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,850
Tangentially related to the
content surrounding it just

123
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:33,390
means that it's not directly
related to, but it expands

124
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,640
upon the content
surrounding it.

125
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,300
However, in HTML5, the
aside element now

126
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,670
covers various contexts.

127
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,470
When used within an article
element, the aside content

128
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,790
should be related to that
particular article that it's

129
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,040
contained within.

130
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,820
However, when it's used outside
an article element,

131
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,820
the aside content should be
specifically related to the

132
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,660
site as a whole.

133
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,980
The second definition closely
resembles the definition for a

134
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,610
sidebar of a site.

135
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,400
Now it's important to note that
an aside element is most

136
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,170
appropriate when it's used to
represent content that's not

137
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,160
the primary focus of an article
or page, but it's

138
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,730
still related to that
article or page.

139
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:18,120
Over here, we can see that we
have secondary content related

140
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,010
to the site as a whole.

141
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,830
So let's look at how we
could mark this up.

142
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,940
Now prior to HTML5, we would
have marked this up with a

143
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,030
div, with a class or ID of
sidebar, and then the markup

144
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,640
contained within.

145
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,500
In HTML5, though, we can
instead use the aside

146
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,400
element, and then all of our
markup contained within that,

147
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,280
which, again, makes our document
more semantic.

148
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,860
Like the header and footer
elements, we can also nest the

149
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,640
aside within HTML elements,
such as the

150
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,710
section, like here.

151
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,210
Now this is an aside for this
particular section element.

152
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,890
So now that we've covered the
aside element, let's move on

153
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,050
to talk about the nav element.

154
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,430
Now by definition, the nav
element represents a section

155
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,990
of a page that links to
other pages, or to

156
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,410
parts within that page.

157
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:10,570
It's essentially just a
section with navigation links.

158
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,140
Now it's important to note
that the nav element is

159
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,630
intended for major navigation.

160
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,060
We can see that we have major
navigation for the site, which

161
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,470
is a good use of the
nav element.

162
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,670
Prior to HTML5, we would have
marked this up with, probably,

163
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,620
an unordered list, with a class
or ID of nav, and then

164
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,610
our list items and anchor links
contained within that.

165
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,840
In HTML5, though, we can
instead use the nav element

166
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,570
and nest our unordered list with
the list items and anchor

167
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,630
links inside of that
nav element.

168
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,180
Again this is making our
document more semantic.

169
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,275
It's more clear, and it
has more meaning.

170
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,240
So that's it for the first
group of HTML5 elements.

171
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,330
Now let's give you some
challenges so you can test out

172
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,580
your skills.
