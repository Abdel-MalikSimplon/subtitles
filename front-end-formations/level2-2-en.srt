1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,370
Welcome back to Level Two.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:08,230
We just have a few more HTML5
elements to look at.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,820
So now let's take a look at the
article element in HTML5.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,530
Now, by definition, the article
element represents a

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:18,270
complete or self-contained part
of a document that is

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,660
technically just independently
reusable or distributable.

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,550
It's just something that we
could use in syndication.

8
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,430
Now, an article element is
essentially just another type

9
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:28,210
of section.

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:32,810
It's used for self-contained
related content.

11
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,290
Now, you might ask, how do we
determine if a particular

12
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,530
piece of content is
self-contained?

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,030
That's a great question.

14
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,680
You need to ask yourself if
you would syndicate that

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,100
particular piece of content
in an RSS or Atom feed.

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,780
So let's look at some example
uses for the article tag.

17
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,800
We have things like a blog post,
a news story, a comment

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,680
on a post, or even a review.

19
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,970
Looking at our sample art
gallery site, we can see that

20
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,540
we have syndicated content for
each new gallery item.

21
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,370
This is a great example of using
the article element.

22
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,740
So let's go ahead and look at
how we would mark this up.

23
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,540
Prior to HTML5, we would have
marked this up with a div,

24
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,390
with a class or ID of article,
and then all of the markup

25
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,720
contained within.

26
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,500
In HTML5, though, we can
instead use the article

27
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,100
element, which is going to make
our document and this

28
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,440
particular piece of syndicated
content more semantic.

29
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,115
And again, that will make our
markup have more meaning.

30
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,650
So now let's move on
to talk about the

31
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,490
main element in HTML5.

32
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,000
The main element, as you might
expect, represents the main

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,170
content of the body of a
document or application.

34
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,630
The main content area consists
of content that either

35
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,700
directly relates to or expands
upon the central

36
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,030
topic of the document.

37
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,400
Let's look at a couple of don'ts
with the main element.

38
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,890
We don't want to include more
than one main element in our

39
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,410
document, and we also don't
want to include the main

40
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:03,020
element inside of other HTML5
elements like the article,

41
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:07,950
aside, footer, the header,
and the nav element.

42
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,280
Jumping back to our art gallery,
we can see we have a

43
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,940
main content section that
directly relates to the

44
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,040
central topic of this document,
which is a gallery.

45
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,530
Let's see how we can mark up
this particular section.

46
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,540
Prior to HTML5, we would have
marked this up using a div

47
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,810
with a class or ID of main, and
then our markup contained

48
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,140
within that.

49
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,190
In HTML5, though, we can instead
use the main element

50
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,980
to wrap this markup, which
gives our document more

51
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,650
semantic meaning.

52
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,510
Once again, we've
achieved further

53
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,160
clarity in our HTML document.

54
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,760
So that's it for the
main element.

55
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,310
Let's now look at
the figure and

56
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,260
figcaption elements in HTML5.

57
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,800
First, let's look at the
figure element.

58
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,540
The figure element, by
definition, represents a unit

59
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,300
of content that may or may
not have a caption that's

60
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,010
self-contained that, if removed
from the flow of the

61
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:04,000
document, will not affect
the document's meaning.

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,040
A common use case for the figure
element is for an image

63
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,530
within an article.

64
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,650
Here we have a figure element,
and then an image nested

65
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,050
inside of that.

66
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,800
Now let's quickly look at the
figcaption element to see how

67
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,000
it works with the
figure element.

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,310
By definition, the figcaption
element represents a caption

69
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,950
or a legend for its parent
figure, the element

70
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,600
we just looked at.

71
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,710
So for our existing figure
element, we add a figcaption

72
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:34,020
element that contains a caption
for the picture.

73
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,780
The output of these elements
looks something like this.

74
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,210
We have our image and the
caption for that image within

75
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,460
the figure element.

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,800
So now let's wrap up the HTML5
elements by talking about the

77
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,050
time element.

78
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,800
The time element, by definition,
represents either

79
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,390
a time on a 24 hour clock or a
precise date in the proleptic

80
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,340
Gregorian calendar, optionally
with a time

81
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,700
and a time zone offset.

82
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,840
Looking at our art gallery site,
you can see that we have

83
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,660
these published on dates for
each of our new gallery items.

84
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,480
This is a perfect use for
the time element.

85
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,900
So here we're using the time
element with our date in

86
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,870
between that.

87
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,230
But we actually want to use
a different format for our

88
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,019
date - the one we just showed -

89
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,580
so we're going to put that date
format here within the

90
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,470
content for our time tag.

91
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,980
We need to make an important
change in order to use that

92
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,990
date format.

93
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,160
We have to add the datetime
attribute to our time element

94
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,130
with that particular date
format, and this allows us to

95
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:38,220
use any relevant content to the
date or time within the

96
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,210
time element.

97
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,100
If we didn't use that datetime
attribute on the time element,

98
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,100
the content must either
be a valid date, time,

99
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,900
or a precise datetime.

100
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,800
There they are -

101
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,880
all of the HTML5 elements.

102
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,850
We're going to give you a few
challenges, and we'll see you

103
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,260
back in level three.

104
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,782
FOO-TA. The FOO-TA!

105
00:05:00,782 --> 00:05:04,690
Hey, Footer, we're going
down to Jim's Crocodile Bar.

106
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,790
So the footer - so the
footer is a footer?

107
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,800
Is that what you're telling me?

108
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,050
All right.
