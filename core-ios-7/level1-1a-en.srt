00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,470
Hi, and welcome to Core iOS 7.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,340
I'm John Friskics.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,610
And in this course, we're going
to be talking about some

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,630
of the exciting new advancements
that the iOS 7

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,390
SDK brings and how to work with
all these new tools, as

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,840
you build your apps for this
new operating system.

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,060
In this level, we're going to
be talking about some of the

8
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,760
important changes to the way
that views are laid out, in a

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,740
view hierarchy.

10
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,660
So, let's get started.

11
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,440
To help us understand how this
has changed from iOS 6, we've

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,990
created a sample app called
Senator Showdown using iOS 6.

13
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,230
And we're going to show you
how some of the elements

14
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,800
inside of that app change
as we transition

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,050
it over to iOS 7.

16
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,730
In the first half of this app
you can see that in iOS 6 the

17
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,360
view used to sit below
the status bar, 

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,500
but in iOS 7 the view actually
slides under the status bar.

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,110
This is going to be a common
pattern in the way that views

20
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,450
are displayed in iOS 7.

21
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,590
You also see that in the iOS 6
version, our buttons have a

22
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,520
rounded rectangle border.

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,210
And in iOS 7, those borders
don't exist anymore.

24
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,380
They're actually gone
from the system.

25
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,020
Finally, you'll notice that in
iOS 6, we've got a purple tab

26
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,560
bar with some tab
bar items on it.

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,330
But in iOS 7, that bottom tab
bar is actually translucent,

28
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,810
and the purple that we're seeing
is the purple seeping

29
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,310
in from the view below it.

30
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,220
Now in our history view
controller, in iOS 6, you can

31
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,780
see that the status bar was
separate from the nav bar.

32
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,920
While in iOS 7, they're
actually connected

33
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,480
into one big bar.

34
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,180
That's going to be important.

35
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,540
The tint color that's been added
in iOS 6, to make the

36
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,740
top and bottom bars purple,
is not showing in iOS 7.

37
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,190
And finally the tab bar image
has a detail selection state

38
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,070
that is inverting the color from
the normal color to this

39
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,180
sort of blue highlight.

40
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,150
While in iOS 7, the tint color
is actually being applied to

41
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,460
the tab bar icon, turning
it purple.

42
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,690
Looking at this detailed view
controller, you can see that

43
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,230
many of the UI kit elements
actually have different

44
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,900
default styles.

45
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,480
And even things like fonts
and font attributes are

46
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,740
slightly different between iOS
6 and iOS 7, even if we're

47
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,815
using the same font
on both systems.

48
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,940
Here you'll notice one of the
biggest differences between

49
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,240
views in iOS 6 and 7.

50
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,030
In iOS 6, this view is taking
up only as much space as is

51
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,760
available underneath the status
bar and the tab bar.

52
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,740
But over and iOS 7, that
view is actually

53
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,350
taking up the full screen.

54
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,060
Views in iOS 7 naturally try to
fill up the entire screen.

55
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,350
If we look at this in a little
more detail, we can see that

56
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:59,940
the status bar on iOS 6
was 20 points high.

57
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,070
And the space between the first
label on here, the won

58
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,210
and lost labels, and that status
bar, is 40 points.

59
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,410
But if we look at the same
view in iOS 7, while the

60
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:14,510
status bar content still is 20
point high, that content does

61
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:17,850
not influence the top
of the layout.

62
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,820
And you see that the space
between the won and lost

63
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,050
labels, and the very
top of the screen,

64
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,650
is now that 40 pixels.

65
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,780
Thus, it's not influenced
by the status bar.

66
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,980
You have two options for
how you can display the

67
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,245
status bar in iOS 7.

68
00:03:35,245 --> 00:03:38,600
You can either display it as a
black text on a transparent

69
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,850
background, or white text on
a transparent background.

70
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,250
And you can set that by
overriding the method

71
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,740
preferred status bar style
in your view controller.

72
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,390
The default is to have black
text on a transparent

73
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,270
background, but if you want to
be white text, then you can

74
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,420
override the preferred status
bar style method, inside of

75
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,450
your view controller, and return
the UI status bar style

76
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,700
light content constant.

77
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,050
If you decide that you don't
want the status bar showing in

78
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,660
one of your view controllers,
you can override the preferred

79
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,210
status bar hidden method,
and return yes.

80
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,220
And then when you load that view
controller, the status

81
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,980
bar will disappear.

82
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,790
Now remember that hiding the
status bar won't affect your

83
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,600
layout dimensions at all,
because it's not used in the

84
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,300
calculation of frames anymore.

85
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,370
And now it's time for you to
work on some challenges.
