1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,580
Welcome back.

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,320
In this level, we're going to
take the Senator Showdown app

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,710
that we used in level one and
we're going to reimplement

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,950
some of the layout using
Auto Layout.

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,630
We've already completed the
initial steps of dragging in

7
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:17,870
each of the views--

8
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,360
in this case, all UI labels.

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,920
We've set their initial
properties, like their frame

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,700
and their text color.

11
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,600
And we've arranged them all
around the general location

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,240
that we want them to be.

13
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,130
If we run the app that contains
this layout, it's

14
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,180
going to look something
like this.

15
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,440
Obviously, we've got a little
bit of work to do before this

16
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,250
is working perfectly.

17
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,050
So we need to add constraints to
position each one of these

18
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,210
views in the right spot and to
make sure that these labels

19
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,460
don't get truncated.

20
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,850

21
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,280
Before we add any constraints,
we'll want to make sure that

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,020
our outline view is
easily readable.

23
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,410
Because there's lots of views,
there's going to be lots of

24
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,530
constraints.

25
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,510
So the more descriptive we can
make our names and the shorter

26
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,060
we can make those descriptions,
the easier it's

27
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,910
going to be to read those
constraints once

28
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,280
they've been added.

29
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,760
So something like this where
we're repeating the word

30
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,610
"label" a lot is going to get
really confusing when we see

31
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,930
it listed multiple times.

32
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,180
Instead, we'll rename each of
our views to more concise

33
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,670
names, and we'll order them in
the outline from top down.

34
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,000
So now, when we're looking at
the order of our views in the

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,190
outline, it mimics the order
that those views

36
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,440
appear in the editor.

37
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,520

38
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,750
There's two different
ways to add

39
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,980
constraints in this layout.

40
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,470
The first one is right clicking
and dragging between

41
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,920
views in the Editor panel.

42
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,840
The pro is that this is visual
and it's easy to understand

43
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,910
the constraints that
you're applying.

44
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,170
But the con is that it's very
easy to accidentally click and

45
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,200
drag onto the wrong view or
one of its super views.

46
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,940
And if you do this, you're going
to end up adding the

47
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,190
wrong constraint.

48
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:05,140

49
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,190
The second approach is to right
click and drag directly

50
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,370
between views in the outline.

51
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,690
And the pro of this is that you
don't need to worry about

52
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,830
creating constraints between the
wrong views because you're

53
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,490
directly adding them from
one to the other.

54
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,470
But it becomes much harder to
visualize exactly how these

55
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,120
constraints work together
in the layout.

56
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,770

57
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,310
Once you get used to both of
these approaches, it's not

58
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,840
uncommon to mix and match and go
back and forth while you're

59
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,090
working on a layout.

60
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,210

61
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,350
Here, I'll add constraints
directly into the editor.

62
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,580
But you'll notice that, as I
add a top constraint and a

63
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,210
leading space constraint, that
the constraints turn blue

64
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,525
without having to add a
width and a height.

65
00:02:48,525 --> 00:02:49,770
And that's kind of strange.

66
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,730
We said before that we always
need to have an X, Y, width,

67
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,050
and height constraint
in order for the

68
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,920
constraints to turn blue.

69
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,500
So why do we only need to
declare X and Y here?

70
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,230

71
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,950
Well, some views have something
called an intrinsic

72
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,950
content size that determines
their width and height at run

73
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,170
time based on their font
and text properties.

74
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:18,890
So things like UI labels, UI
buttons, and even UI image

75
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,340
views that have an image inside
of them in Interface

76
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,550
Builder all define an intrinsic
content size,

77
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,210
meaning their width and height
is predetermined.

78
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,280
In fact, you don't want to set
width and height constraints

79
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,000
on views that have an intrinsic
content size,

80
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,530
because they'll automatically
be calculated for you

81
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,780
when the app runs.

82
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,860

83
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,380
Since these are all UI labels,
we're only going to need to

84
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,890
add X and Y positions for
each of these views.

85
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,330
We'll start by adding a
constraint between the Won and

86
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,610
Lost labels using the horizontal
spacing and

87
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,600
baseline constraints.

88
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,760
Then we'll connect up the Won
and Lost number place holders

89
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,300
using vertical spacing and
center X so that W and L stay

90
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,850
centered on the Won and Lost.

91
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,620
We'll connect up the percent
sign to the W using vertical

92
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,430
spacing and to the super view
using center horizontally so

93
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,769
it stays in the middle of the
view, and then connect up the

94
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:19,790
rest of these views at the
bottom, mainly using vertical

95
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:23,480
spacing and either left or right
positioning, just to

96
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,240
keep them aligned with
each other and fixed

97
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,625
inside of this grid.

98
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:29,510
When we're all finished, these
constraints turn blue.

99
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,670
And again, that's a sign that
we've done something right.

100
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,470

101
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,900
Now, if we run this in the
simulator, we can see that our

102
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,590
layout looks a lot better
than it did

103
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,790
before in portrait mode.

104
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,690
If we rotate the device into
landscape mode, we've got a

105
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,160
few problems.

106
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,050
First everything's pushed over
to the left a little bit.

107
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,980
And we probably want all of
that to be in the center.

108
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,730
And since landscape doesn't have
as much vertical space,

109
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,370
now we need to put all of this
inside of a scroll view so

110
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,335
that we can scroll and see
all of the content.

111
00:04:59,335 --> 00:05:02,500

112
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,480
Let's tackle the first problem
that some of the

113
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,110
views are not centered.

114
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,010
If we look at all of our
constraints, we've got a

115
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,020
leading space constraint
on the Won label.

116
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,900
This constraint is actually
saying to always position the

117
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,600
Won label that amount of points
from the left edge.

118
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,770
And that's why it's pulling it
over to the left when we

119
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,380
rotate the screen.

120
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,950
If we delete the leading
constraint and replace it with

121
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,750
a center horizontally in
container constraint, then

122
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,390
we're going to be able to center
everything inside of

123
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,880
the superview.

124
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,180
Notice that when we do this,
the center constraint is

125
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,095
actually offset by 59 points.

126
00:05:39,095 --> 00:05:41,900
And this is because the Won
label doesn't appear directly

127
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,810
in the center of the layout.

128
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,830
It's offset over to the left
by a little bit, but it's

129
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,400
still anchored to that center.

130
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,130

131
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,820
Now, when we re-run this in
the simulator and view in

132
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,300
landscape mode, everything
is centered.

133
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,600
But we still have the problem
of not being able to see all

134
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,740
the content because we
need to embed all of

135
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,993
this in a scroll view.

136
00:06:01,993 --> 00:06:05,240

137
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,800
Now, there's some good
and bad news here.

138
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,740
The good news is that Xcode
provides a menu option to

139
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,650
directly create a scroll view
for a set of views.

140
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,990
So we'll start by highlighting
all the views that we want to

141
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,870
put in the scroll view and then
choose Editor, Embed in

142
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,650
Scroll View.

143
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,160
And when we choose that, all of
those views will get placed

144
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,781
directly inside of
a scroll view.

145
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:29,670

146
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,200
The bad news is that all of the
constraints have now been

147
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,320
reset because our superview
has changed.

148
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,790
So we'll need to go through the
process of re-adding all

149
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,940
of these constraints.

150
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,910
In addition, we need to add
constraints for the scroll

151
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,270
view itself so that
it sits correctly

152
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,370
inside of the main view.

153
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,800
Adding constraints for the
scroll view is pretty easy,

154
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,270
though, because we need it to
always take up the entire

155
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,880
available space.

156
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,810
So we can do that by adding a
top space, leading space,

157
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,700
center horizontally, and center
vertically constraint.

158
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,110
And then that scroll view will
always take up the entire

159
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,760
available space of the view
in either portrait

160
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,010
or landscape mode.

161
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:23,980

162
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,810
We've gone through the process
of adding all those

163
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,260
constraints back, so we don't
have to show it again here.

164
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,020
But you'll notice that that
orange arrow is now appearing

165
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,210
when we add those constraints.

166
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,860
And if we click on it to see
the debugging inspector,

167
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,380
you'll see that we have a new
error called Scrollable

168
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,510
Content Size Ambiguity for both
the height and the width.

169
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,480
We're getting this error,
because we need to set the

170
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,920
content size for our
scroll view.

171
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,710
Now, unfortunately, there's no
option in the Inspector panel

172
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,060
in Interface Builder to just
set a content size.

173
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,460
But we can use Auto
Layout to set it.

174
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,440

175
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,180
To do this, you'll want to find
the view in the scroll

176
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,910
view that is closest to
the bottom and right

177
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,430
of the scroll view.

178
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,420
In this case, our Party label
is both the closest to the

179
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,580
right edge and the bottom
of the screen.

180
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,640

181
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,240
Next, we'll add trailing and
bottom constraints to that

182
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,490
Party label.

183
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,640

184
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,650
And finally, in the editor,
we'll double click each of

185
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:33,720
those constraints and reset the
constant to be equal to 0.

186
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,789
Here, you can see setting the
trailing constraint constant

187
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:40,640
to 0 and the bottom constraint
constant to 0.

188
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,210

189
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,400
This is a little bit of
Auto Layout magic.

190
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,050
Setting those constants to 0
let's Auto Layout know to use

191
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:53,020
the minimum amount of space
needed for the content size of

192
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,740
the scroll view.

193
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,710
And here, you can see that as we
switch between portrait and

194
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,550
landscape, we're able to scroll
and see all of the

195
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:04,960
available content in
our layout now.

196
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,840
There's another great new
feature in iOS 7 that you can

197
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,060
activate by navigating to the
very top left of your outline

198
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,090
view and choosing
Preview and then

199
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,480
highlighting the xib file.

200
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,430

201
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,640
Now, if you hold Shift and
Option at the same time and

202
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,940
click on that file, you'll get
this little display inspector.

203
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,730
If you double tap on the right
panel, it'll actually open up

204
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,500
a second preview window
inside of the editor.

205
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,070

206
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:40,130
If you then click on the Apply
Landscape Orientation button

207
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:43,630
at the bottom right, you'll be
able to get a live preview of

208
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:47,140
both the portrait mode and the
landscape mode while you're

209
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,750
editing and changing
your constraints.

210
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,690
This is a great new feature,
because it means that you

211
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,930
don't always have to keep
re-running the app in the

212
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,340
simulator and flipping the
orientation manually in order

213
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,700
to see the changes that you're
making to your Auto Layout

214
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,950
constraints.

215
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,370

216
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,780
Now, it's time for you to work
with Auto Layout and scroll

217
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,270
views in the challenges.

218
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,520
Good luck.

219
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,521
