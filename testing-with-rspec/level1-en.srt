00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,950
[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,553
You're watching testing
with RSpec.

3
00:00:28,553 --> 00:00:30,930
I'm Gregg Pollack and this is
level one where we're going to

4
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,560
go over an introduction to RSpec
and start writing our

5
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,870
first specifications.

6
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,320
RSpec is one of the most
popular Ruby testing

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:38,920
frameworks.

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,200
And because it is so popular,
there's a huge community of

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,300
developers behind it which
means there's lots of

10
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,420
extensions and add-ons to it.

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,230
It also has a less
Ruby-like syntax.

12
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,000
You might call it a
domain-specific

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,690
language for testing.

14
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,430
In case you're not familiar
with that term,

15
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,800
domain-specific language, or
DSL, it means that we've taken

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,080
Ruby and RSpec has added
additional language features

17
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,200
on top of that to create the
most efficient language for

18
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,980
testing your code.

19
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,340
RSpec also has very good outputs
when you run your

20
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,860
tests so you can very easily
see what has gone wrong in

21
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,940
your code so you can
quickly debug it.

22
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,340
RSpec evolved out of this idea
called behavior-driven

23
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,330
development, or BDD.

24
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,880
There are several types
of testing.

25
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,700
You've got verification
testing, test-driven

26
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,260
development, and you could say
one level above that is

27
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,000
behavior-driven development
where we really focus on

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,900
describing the behavior
of our application.

29
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,190
And you'll see that RSpec and
the RSpec syntax makes it

30
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,440
really easy to do this.

31
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,420


32
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,890
All right.

33
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,260
Let's jump into building
our first

34
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,100
RSpec application together.

35
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,380
First step, obviously, we
need to install the gem.

36
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,010
So we just type gem
install rspec.

37
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,810
That's going to install RSpec
and all of its dependencies.

38
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,700
Then inside of our project
directory, we're going to call

39
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,160
rspec --init.

40
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,090
That's going to initialize two
files for us-- the spec helper

41
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,650
and the .rspec file, which
will go into more

42
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,860
detail in level two.

43
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,190
In our application, we're going
to be building a zombie.

44
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,419
Big surprise there.

45
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:15,890
That zombie.rb file is going to
live in our /lib directory.

46
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,970
So let's go ahead and create the
first test, before we even

47
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,760
write the zombie, that
describes the

48
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,930
behavior of our zombie.

49
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,480
In RSpec, instead of using the
word test we often substitute

50
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,080
the word specification.

51
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,560
But it basically means
the same thing.

52
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,030
This is why we're going to put
all of our specifications in

53
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,900
the spec directory.

54
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,040
Our zombies lives in that lib
directory, so we're going to

55
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,950
put our first zombie test inside
that lib directory.

56
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,270
Oops, I said test.

57
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,830
I meant specification.

58
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,840
And so our zombie specification
is going to be

59
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,090
called zombie_spec.rb .

60
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,470


61
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,680
With test unit, remember that
would have been zombie_test.

62
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,330
But we use specifications.

63
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,580
So we use zombie_spec.rb.

64
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,510


65
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,750
Inside this file we're going
to require the spec helper,

66
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,240
which will load the
configuration for the

67
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,560
specification.

68
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,300
Now we need to describe how we
want a zombie to behave.

69
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,450
So we start with writing
a describe block.

70
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,970
And we say describe
"A Zombie" do.

71
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,470
And we would then
put our test--

72
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,620
but we don't call them
tests in here.

73
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,400
We call them examples.

74
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,680
Here's another terminology
switch.

75
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,040
So we need to provide a lot of
examples to test our zombie

76
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,390
inside of our specification.

77
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,850
Hope you followed.

78
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,550
We want our zombie
to be named Ash.

79
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,520
So let's start describing
that behavior.

80
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,530
We're going to do that and
declare our first example by

81
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,880
using the it method.

82
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,400
So we're going to say
it is named Ash.

83
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,090
We haven't fleshed out the
example yet, but we're going

84
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,100
to run this spec anyways.

85
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,280
To do this on the command line,
we simply write rspec

86
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,360
and then the full path
to the file.

87
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,790
As you can see here, we have
one pending example.

88
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,680
Before we flesh out that example
though, I'm going to

89
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,020
show you a more typical syntax
that you would use in your

90
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,420
specifications.

91
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,480
Instead of saying a zombie as
a string at the top, instead

92
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,270
we're going to put the name of
the class that we're writing

93
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,230
examples for.

94
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,670
So we write describe zombie.

95
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,519
If we run this test again,
you're going to see-- uh oh.

96
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,709
It failed because--

97
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,779
well, we don't have that
zombie class yet.

98
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:22,830
So let's go ahead
and define it.

99
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,730
So as you can see above, inside
of our lib directory

100
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,330
we're creating our zombie.rb.

101
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,840
All we're going to do inside
there is declare our class.

102
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,250
Now back inside of our
specification, all we need to

103
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,960
do is require that class.

104
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,380
Then we can rerun the
specification on the command

105
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,390
line and here we are again.

106
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,570
We have one pending example.

107
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:46,000
Now let's write out the rest
of that example by first

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,600
creating a new zombie.

109
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,400
Then we're going to write zombie
name should equal Ash.

110
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,800
And we call that
an expectation.

111
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,080
If you went through Rails
Testing for Zombies, you might

112
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,450
have written an assertion which
looks like this, with

113
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,360
assert equals Ash zombie name.

114
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,100
Whereas with RSpec, we would
write it like this.

115
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,360
Zombie name should equal Ash.

116
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,630
And we call that--

117
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,570
not an assertion.

118
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,100
We call that an expectation.

119
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,530
And as you can see, it reads
a lot better than those

120
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,130
assertions.

121
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,735
Now if we run the test again,
it properly fails.

122
00:05:19,735 --> 00:05:20,470
Woohoo.

123
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,850
We have our first failing
valid test.

124
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,260
So now we can start implementing
our zombie.

125
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,120
So inside of a zombie, we're
going to declare

126
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,780
an attribute accessor.

127
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:35,060
And inside of our initialize
method set its name to Ash.

128
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,590
So if we run our specification,
it passes.

129
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,970
From here, let's go ahead and
write another example inside

130
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,610
of our specification.

131
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,360
We're going to make sure zombie
has no brains when it

132
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,520
gets instantiated.

133
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,340
So we create our new zombie.

134
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,440
We test that zombie brain
should be less than one.

135
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,560
There's two components here
you should be aware of.

136
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,550
Ah, more terminology.

137
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,970
The modifier is should.

138
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,300
Should is the modifier
on our test.

139
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,860
And the matcher in this case
is that less than sign.

140
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,500
Later on in this course we're
going to be creating our own

141
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,270
custom matchers, which we
combine with modifiers.

142
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,500
If we run this test, it doesn't

143
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,250
pass, as we would expect.

144
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,890
After writing the failing test,
we can go back into

145
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,170
zombie class.

146
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:24,920
We can create a new attribute
accessor with brains.

147
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,410
And on the initialize set
brains equal to 0.

148
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:32,140
Then when we run the
spec, it passes.

149
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,460
Let's take a look at a couple
other examples of matchers that

150
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,080
you might use inside your
specifications.

151
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,510
We can check that zombie.alive
should equal false.

152
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:44,840
Another way we could write this
is zombie.alive should be

153
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,230
false using the be matcher.

154
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,300
We can check that zombie.rotting
should equal true, or

155
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,840
use the be true matcher.

156
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,450
We can check that height should
be greater than 5 or

157
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,450
greater than or equal
or less than.

158
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,440
We could also use the be matcher
in there if we like

159
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,380
the way that reads.

160
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,670
We could say brains should
be less than 1.

161
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,410
Completely optional.

162
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,570
Should, again, is
the modifier.

163
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,510
And we can switch out that
should modifier for should not

164
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,210
if you want to test that
the opposite is true.

165
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,620
In Ruby occasionally you run
into methods or you create

166
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,570
methods that end in the question
mark, which means

167
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:24,230
it's a predicate method and that
it returns true or false.

168
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,750
How would we test this
predicate method?

169
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,230
We could write an example that
looks like this to test that

170
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:32,230
zombie hungry should
equals true.

171
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,520
However, there's a better
way to write this.

172
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,160
We could use the be true matcher
that we just saw.

173
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,430
We can also use a predicate
matcher, which, as you can

174
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,280
see, reads really well.

175
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,560
Zombie should be hungry.

176
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,280
So that's going to call be
hungry question mark method on

177
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,560
zombie and test it.

178
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,080
Now if we run the spec again
from the command line, it

179
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,330
still passes.

180
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,310


181
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,670
As you saw at the beginning of
this level, one way to make an

182
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:02,050
example pending is to simply
leave off the example body.

183
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,410
Just have the it without
the do and the end.

184
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,890
And it will be pending.

185
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,920
There are two other ways,
though, you can have pending

186
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,670
examples which could be useful
if you're going back into a

187
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,920
big application and you have a
lot of failing tests and you

188
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,250
want to make one pass at a time,
you might want to make a

189
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:22,300
bunch of them pending and
implement them one at a time.

190
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,500
You can do this in two
different ways.

191
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,450
The first it is by putting
an x before the it.

192
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,420
So you just put x it.

193
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,150
And that will cause the
example to be pending.

194
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:36,130
You can also simply use the
pending keyword inside of your

195
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:40,340
example, and that will cause
the test to be pending.

196
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,460
That's all we have
for level one.

197
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,130
It's time to get your hands
dirty with the challenges.

198
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,060
And Olivier will
see you in level two.

199
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,610
