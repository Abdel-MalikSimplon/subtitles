00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,640
Hi I'm Mark Kendall.

2
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,060
And you're watching
Ruby Bits, Part

3
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:35,600
Two.

4
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,440
This is level three,
"Understanding and Using

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,320
Self." So first let's take a
look at how Ruby sets the

6
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,710
value of Self as our
program executes.

7
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,000
We can do this just by printing
out Self at a few

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,190
different points
in our program.

9
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,940
We'll start by printing it out
before our class definition

10
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,330
and then after we open
our class definition.

11
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,300
And we can see that outside of
the class, Self is a special

12
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,190
object that Ruby creates
called Main.

13
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,330
So even when you're not in a
class, Ruby still has an

14
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,640
object that it's created
for you.

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,460
Inside of our class definition,
Self refers to the

16
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,710
Tweet class object.

17
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,490
So if we go one step further and
we create a Class method

18
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,670
on our Tweet class--

19
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,650
in this case self.find--

20
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,150
and we print out the value of
Self inside of there, we'll

21
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,440
see that, again, Self refers
to the Tweet class object.

22
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,740
So this gives us some insight
into how we define class

23
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,600
methods in Ruby and
how that works.

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,390
Inside of our Tweet class, when
we say def self.find,

25
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,770
Self is referring to that
Tweet class object.

26
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:39,000
So that's really equivalent
to saying def tweet.find.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,310
And our new method gets defined
on the Tweet class.

28
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,602
Now using the class name to
define a class method, while

29
00:01:44,602 --> 00:01:47,100
it works, isn't used
very often in Ruby.

30
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,830
So you'll see the self dot
syntax used a lot more

31
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,940
frequently.

32
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,440
So moving on, here we're
printing out the value of Self

33
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,190
inside of an Instance method,
the Initialize method for our

34
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,160
Tweet object.

35
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,530
Now when create a new Tweet,
we'll see printed out the

36
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,370
value of Self, which is
the Tweet instance

37
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,620
that we just created.

38
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,800
So why is it important to keep
track of the value of Self as

39
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,940
our code executes?

40
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:14,010
Well Ruby uses the value of Self
to figure out where to

41
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,070
call methods.

42
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,110
So if you try to call a method
without an explicit receiver,

43
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,220
without an object and a dot in
front of the method name, Ruby

44
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,590
tries to find that
method in Self.

45
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,490
So let's look at the code that
explains what this means.

46
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,800
Inside of our Tweet class,
the first line is an

47
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,040
attr_accessor.

48
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,265
That's actually just a method.

49
00:02:31,265 --> 00:02:34,430
And Ruby's calling that method
on Self, which is the Tweet

50
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,820
class object.

51
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,490
Then, in Initialize method,
we're setting an Instance

52
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,140
variable, status.

53
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,860
And that Instance variable gets
set on Self, which is the

54
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,170
new instance of our
Tweet class.

55
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,460
And likewise, when we call a
method set_up_some_things,

56
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:56,350
that's being called on the
instance of our Tweet

57
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:59,290
So now that we understand a
little bit more about how Self

58
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,390
works in Ruby, let's look at
ways that we can change that

59
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,320
while our program executes.

60
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,000
The first of these is
class_eval, which is a method

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,830
that you can call
on any class.

62
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,600
And it takes a block and it sets
the value of Self for the

63
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,240
duration of that block, to the
class you called it on.

64
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,900
Let's see how that works.

65
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,600
Here we have a Tweet class
that has two attributes--

66
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,310
status and created at.

67
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,700
And we'd like to add a
third, for the user.

68
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,970
Instead of reopening the class
to add that new attr_accessor,

69
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,570
what we've done here is to call
class_eval on the Tweet

70
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,930
class, which sets the value of
Self to the Tweet class and

71
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,230
runs that block,
thus adding the

72
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,960
attr_accessor to the Tweet.

73
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,880
Now we can create a Tweet, and
we'll see that we have a user

74
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,460
attribute on that tweet
that we can set.

75
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,530
So let's look at a more
complicated example.

76
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,100
Here we'd like to create
a Method Logger class.

77
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,100
And here's how we'd
like to use it:

78
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,260
We'd like to be able to create
a Method Logger.

79
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,520
And then tell it to log a
method, given a class name and

80
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,700
a method name.

81
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,540
We'd like it to attach to that
method, and then print out some

82
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,930
logging information.

83
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,990
How might we implement that?

84
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,530
Before we write any code, let's
think about what this

85
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,610
Method Logger's going
to need to do.

86
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,650
We know that we need to write a
log_method method that takes

87
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,080
the class and the method name
that we're logging.

88
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,279
Inside of that, we're going to
use class_eval to execute some

89
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:21,380
code in the context
of the class.

90
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,290
We'll then use alias_method to
save off the old version of

91
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,420
the method that we're logging,
because we're about to

92
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,550
override it.

93
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,880
And then we'll use define_method
method to

94
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,830
override that method, and
log our method call.

95
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,230
And then use send to call the
original version of the method

96
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,330
that we had saved off.

97
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,260
So how might that
look in code?

98
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,340
So here in our Method Logger
class, we'll implement

99
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,390
log_method.

100
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,920
You'll notice it takes a class
and a method name.

101
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,340
You'll notice here that we've
spelled class with a "k."

102
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,760
That's because class
with a "c" is a

103
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,400
reserved keyword in Ruby.

104
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,170
And so the convention is
to use a "k" instead.

105
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,940
So first we use class_eval.

106
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,890
So now, inside of this block,
Self will be that class that

107
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,940
we're passing in.

108
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,270
And then we can modify that
class by using alias_method to

109
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,610
first save off the
original method.

110
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,020
And then use define_method
to redefine our

111
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,190
method that we're logging.

112
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,670
Inside of that, we're just
printing out the current time

113
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,870
and the method name.

114
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,330
And then we're using send to
call the original method that

115
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,580
we'd saved off earlier.

116
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,880
Now if we run the code that we
looked at earlier, we define

117
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,570
our Method Logger, we tell it
to log the say_hi method on

118
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,790
our Tweet class.

119
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,540
And then we create a new Tweet
instance and call say_hi.

120
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,870
We see our logging.

121
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,420
And then we see "hi" printed
out, because the original

122
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,210
version of the method is
also being called.

123
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,480
You may have noticed that our
Method Logger has one problem.

124
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,240
It only works for methods that
don't take any parameters and

125
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,380
don't take blocks.

126
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,460
Let's see if we can solve
that problem.

127
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,070
What we need to do is
capture the methods

128
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,540
arguments and its block.

129
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,830
Here we're using the Splat
operator to capture the

130
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,640
arguments in an array and the
ampersand to turn the block

131
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,620
into a proc.

132
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,470
That way we have a handle
to both of them.

133
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,130
And we can pass them on to send
when we call the original

134
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,380
version of the method.

135
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,220
So that's class_eval.

136
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,590
Ruby gives us another method
called instance_eval.

137
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,050
And it works much the same way,
except that it sets Self

138
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,340
to an instance of an object,
and then execute to block.

139
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,240
Here we have a simple Tweet
class that just has

140
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,590
attr_accessors for
user and status.

141
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,290
Let's create a new instance of
our Tweet, and then we'll call

142
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,380
instance_eval, which sets the
value of Self to that Tweet

143
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,820
object for the duration
of our block.

144
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,950
Then we can call status_equals
directly.

145
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,370
And it will call the
status_equals

146
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,620
method on our Tweet.

147
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,940
Remember back in level one we
used this code to initialize a

148
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,110
Tweet object?

149
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,880
Well there's some duplication
going on here.

150
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,500
We have to pass the Tweet
into our block.

151
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,170
And then we have to do
tweet.status and tweet.user

152
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:54,080
inside the block to
set its values.

153
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,070
Let's see if we can clean that
up with instance_eval.

154
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,655
To do that, we'll capture the
block that's being passed into

155
00:06:59,655 --> 00:07:01,900
Initialize using
the ampersand.

156
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,250
And then instead of calling
yield, we'll call

157
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,045
instance_eval.

158
00:07:05,045 --> 00:07:07,130
And we'll pass that
block through.

159
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,820
So this executes our block with
Self being set to our new

160
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,970
Tweet object.

161
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,550
And this allows us to not have
to pass the Tweet object into

162
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,140
the block and explicitly put
it in front of each of our

163
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,390
method calls.

164
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,490
We've reached the end
of level three.

165
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,120
So now it's time for you to
discover yourself with these

166
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,020
challenges.

167
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,630
I'll see you back
at Level four.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,880
