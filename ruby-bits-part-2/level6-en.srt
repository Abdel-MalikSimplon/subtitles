1
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,870
You're watching Ruby
Bits, Part Two.

2
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:33,880
This is level six.

3
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,110
We're going to be taking the
DSL that we built in level

4
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:40,190
five and extending
it even further.

5
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,590
Sometimes you learn about ways
that you'd like to modify your

6
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,050
DSL after you start using it.

7
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,260
Let's say, for example, that we
want to create a tweet that

8
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,770
just has text, no hash tags
or links or anything else.

9
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:54,250
Currently in our DSL syntax,
we'd have to do it like this.

10
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,210
Now that works, but it's
a little bit wordy.

11
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,690
It takes three lines of code,
and we'd like to simplify it

12
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,690
to just be a single
line like this.

13
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,760
Let's see how we might modify
our tweet_as method to support

14
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,180
this optional syntax.

15
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,890
First, we can see here that we
need to add an optional second

16
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,450
parameter for the tweet text.

17
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,810
We're defaulting it to
nil in case the user

18
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,430
doesn't specify one.

19
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,600
Then if that tweet text isn't
nil, we just go ahead and set

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,330
that directly after we've
created our tweet.

21
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,220
And finally, we need to make the
block optional by adding

22
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,330
if block_given at the end of
our instance_eval line.

23
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,550
So now we have both optional
text and an optional block.

24
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,245
And that allows us to use either
of our tweet syntaxes.

25
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,600
Here's another example of how we
might want to clean up our

26
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,370
DSL just a little bit.

27
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,680
Right now, if we want to mention
more than one person

28
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,150
in our tweet, we have to
call mention twice.

29
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,570
We'd like to be able to just
call it once and separate the

30
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,820
user names with a comma.

31
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,390
So how might we implement
that?

32
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,510
So if we look at our mention
method right now, it just

33
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,760
takes a single user.

34
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,870
But we can use the splat
operator to turn that into an

35
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,190
array of users.

36
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,510
And then we just have to make
a simple modification to the

37
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,210
method to iterate the users in
that array, and add each one

38
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,460
to our tweet.

39
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,420
Last time I was looking at
Twitter's API, I noticed that

40
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,190
they had recently added the
ability to attach a hash of

41
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,960
annotations to your tweet.

42
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,170
So we'd like to extend our DSL
to be able to support that.

43
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,740
What we'd like to do is to
build up this annotations

44
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,115
hash, with any arbitrary keys
and values, using this syntax

45
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,170
in our DSL.

46
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,730
This is a perfect candidate
for using method missing.

47
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,590
What we need to do is extend
our tweet class.

48
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,370
In its initialized method, we'll
initialize an empty hash

49
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,170
for the annotation.

50
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,640
Then when we submit the tweet
to Twitter, we'll just go

51
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,770
ahead and print those
annotations out to the console

52
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,740
right now so we can see them.

53
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,700
And then to actually fill that
annotations hash, we'll define

54
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,150
method missing.

55
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,760
And what we'll do here is we'll
turn the method name

56
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,480
into the key, and we'll turn the
method arguments into the

57
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,440
value, joining them
with a comma.

58
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,960
So with that, if we submit our
example tweet here, we see

59
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,890
that not only do we get the
tweet content, but we also get

60
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,095
this new annotations hash
with the three values.

61
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,520
One final thing we'd like to
do, just to make our DSL a

62
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,470
little bit easier to
use, is to add some

63
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,090
simple error handling.

64
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,300
So what we want to do here is
make sure that the tweet isn't

65
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,540
too long before we submit
it to Twitter.

66
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,380
We know that Twitter has 140
character limit on tweets.

67
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,690
So let's put that check into our
submit_to_twitter method.

68
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,210
Here we're just checking to see
if the tweet text length

69
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,710
is less than or equal
to 140 characters.

70
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,490
If it is, then we go ahead and
do the handling that we were

71
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,340
doing before.

72
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,280
If it's not, we'll just raise
an exception with a

73
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,830
descriptive message.

74
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,530
So what does this do for a user
that's using our DSL?

75
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,140
Well, if they try to submit
a tweet that's too long--

76
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,560
like this one here--

77
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,600
they'll get an exception with
our message, and they will see

78
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,700
some internal details
of our DSL.

79
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,840
In this case, the Submit
to Twitter method.

80
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,290
But that's a pretty fair
trade-off for adding some

81
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,540
pretty simple error handling.

82
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,899
That's the end of our
discussion of DSLs.

83
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:22,352
So you have some challenges to
do, and I'll see you on the

84
00:04:22,352 --> 00:04:24,990
other side of those challenges
for the outro video.

85
