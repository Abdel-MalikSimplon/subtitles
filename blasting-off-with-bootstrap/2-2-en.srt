00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,430
Welcome back to Blasting
Off with Bootstrap.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,360
This is level two, section
two — Responsive Gridding.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,740
If we take a look at
our website so far,

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,680
it looks great on desktops.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,630
But what happens if
we view it on a phone?

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,680
Well, our columns are all gone.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,320
It turns out that's
because none of the columns

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,010
that we've been using
work below 992 pixels.

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,710
Let's take a look at what
we can do to fix this.

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,350
Here's what we want our page
to look like on a phone.

11
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,960
We really don't need that big
image on smaller resolutions.

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,460
And also, we still
want our featured items

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,820
to take up some
horizontal space.

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,270
But we really want "Book
Today!" to be on its own row,

15
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,200
since that's the
most important thing.

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,250
You'll notice this
little icon up here?

17
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,680
That means that we're seeing the
same thing that a phone would

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,210
see for this screenshot.

19
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,080
So far, we have concentrated
on getting our site

20
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,610
looking great on medium-sized
screens — things like laptops.

21
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:07,430
To do that, we use that col-md-*
class and the col-md-offset-*

22
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,280
one.

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,360
But these only work for screen
sizes of 992 pixels and larger.

24
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,500
For smaller resolutions, like
tablets and even compact laptop

25
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,410
screens, there's another great
size we could be designing for.

26
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,860
And that's called
the small size.

27
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,270
The small size uses
similar classes

28
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,420
to the ones we've
worked with so far,

29
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,380
except we replace the md
part with the sm part.

30
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:38,420
The small grid size will work
for screen sizes of 768 pixels

31
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,210
and above.

32
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,660
Let's see how we can use
our grids for small devices.

33
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,100
If we take a look at
our features so far,

34
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,730
we'll see we're using
the col-md-4 class.

35
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:54,710
Now this class is only working
for resolutions of 992 pixels

36
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,540
and up.

37
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,240
So nothing is happening
for our small screen sizes.

38
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,630
What can we do differently
to make this work on tablets?

39
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,840
By changing this
class to col-sm-4,

40
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,490
now these featured
items are all going

41
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:14,200
to take up four columns in
small- and medium-sized devices.

42
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,060
So if we take a look at how
this looks in a medium device,

43
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,800
you'll see that it looks
exactly the same as before.

44
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,210
Our features are still
spanning four columns.

45
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,620
You'll see from the
little laptop icon,

46
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,680
this is us viewing the
page in medium mode.

47
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,180
But what if we check it out
in small mode, represented

48
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,440
by this tablet?

49
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,540
Notice how even though
our page is a lot smaller,

50
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,190
our featured items are still
taking up four columns.

51
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,250
Each of these columns
is a little bit smaller

52
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,845
because our page
itself is smaller.

53
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,270
But if we shrink the
page a little more,

54
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,030
well, our columns are
going to disappear again.

55
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,190
That's because our
grids were only

56
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:02,820
being applied for screen
sizes of 768 pixels and above.

57
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,720
What about below 768 pixels?

58
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,050
Let's take a look
at extra-small mode,

59
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:12,160
which is what you'd see if you
viewed your site on a phone.

60
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,350
When designing for extra-small
devices like phones,

61
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,210
you can use this
col-xs prefix for all

62
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,050
of your grids and offsets.

63
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,370
This will be applied for
screens zero pixels and above.

64
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,810
This is great for
applying a minimum width

65
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,050
for your elements, things that
will be applied across all grid

66
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:29,590
sizes.

67
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,040
The extra-small classes
are great for specifying

68
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,240
a minimum width on
elements, assuming

69
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,010
you don't override them
with another grid class

70
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,990
from a larger size.

71
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,180
If we wanted our
featured items to take up

72
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,120
a little more horizontal
space on extra-small screens,

73
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,740
one way we could
do that might be

74
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,030
to add a col-xs-4 class
to our featured items.

75
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,260
But if we view that on
an extra-small device,

76
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,590
it looks a little cramped.

77
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,060
This is going to be very hard to
read on an extra-small device.

78
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,140
I think we could
do a lot better.

79
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,820
Let's rewind things
a bit and see

80
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,360
what we want our featured
items to look like.

81
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,430
We really want our "Book Today!"
feature to take up 10 columns

82
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,190
and have one column
of offset before it.

83
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,750
Next, we want the
other two features

84
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,829
to each take up six columns.

85
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:23,050
Let's start off by making
the "Book Today!" part take up

86
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,040
an entire 12 columns
in extra-small mode.

87
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,270
Next, we want "Go
Anywhere" and "RocketBus"

88
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,490
to be below "Book
Today!", but each of them

89
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,930
will take up six columns.

90
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,140
To do that, we can add a
col-xs-6 to each of them.

91
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:46,180
If we take a look at this
on an extra-small device,

92
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,840
we'll see that our "Book Today!"
element is spanning 12 columns,

93
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,450
and also that our "Go Anywhere"
and "RocketBus" are both

94
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,320
spanning six.

95
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,040
So why is it that
we were able to use

96
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,190
24 columns in this
row, rather than 12?

97
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,800
You'll notice that "Book Today!"
is using all 12 columns,

98
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,510
like we told it to.

99
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,150
But it's also pushed down
"Go Anywhere" and "RocketBus"

100
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,610
to the next available
vertical space below it.

101
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,430
We could still improve
this a little bit more.

102
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,060
What we really want
to do is for people

103
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,790
to read the "Book Today!" part.

104
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,370
So let's make that stand
out a little bit more

105
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,820
on extra-small devices.

106
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,160
How can we do that?

107
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,730
Well, we don't want
"Book Today!" to take up

108
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:32,340
all 12 columns in
extra-small mode.

109
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,490
Instead, we really
want it to take up

110
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,830
just the middle 10 columns.

111
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,380
In order for it to take
up the middle 10 columns,

112
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,640
we need to give it a column
of padding on the left.

113
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,840
To do that, we can
use an offset of one

114
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,230
that only is applied
for extra-small devices.

115
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,750
Remember, the order that we
add these classes to our HTML

116
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,940
doesn't matter.

117
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,730
Let's check this out on
an extra-small device.

118
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,760
We'll see that
"Book Today!" shows up

119
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,790
centered with an empty
column on the left

120
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,930
and another empty
column on the right.

121
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,050
"Go Anywhere" and "RocketBus" each
take up six columns, adding up

122
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,770
to 12 to take up the entire row.

123
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,580
What's important to
note here is that we've

124
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,430
used only 11 total
columns to accomplish

125
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,850
this centering effect.

126
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,760
The remaining one
column to the right

127
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,040
of "Book Today!" wasn't used
because nothing was there

128
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,760
except empty space.

129
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,610
If we had made "Book
Today!" take 11 columns,

130
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,530
we wouldn't have the
centering effect.

131
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,750
When "Go Anywhere"
and "RocketBus" try

132
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,650
to find a place
on the page, they

133
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,890
can't roll up right
next to "Book Today!"

134
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,730
because there's only one
column of space left.

135
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:42,070
So Bootstrap puts them
where space is available.

136
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:46,440
In this case, the next
horizontal space down.

137
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,010
If we preview our site
again in small mode,

138
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,320
we'll see that
our featured items

139
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,590
don't look like
we'd expect them to.

140
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,770
Our offset that we added
for extra-small mode, well,

141
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,780
it's actually being applied for
small and medium resolutions

142
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,330
as well, because we
haven't overridden it

143
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,850
for those larger sizes.

144
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:07,380
Since we're using nine columns
in the first horizontal space,

145
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,580
"RocketBus" is moved
to the next row.

146
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,100
Let's check out how to override
this offset for small screens

147
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,600
and above.

148
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,840
To do that, we can add
another class, which

149
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,680
will remove the offset for
small devices and above.

150
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,470
In this case, we can add
a col-sm-offset-0 class.

151
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,160
This is essentially removing
that offset for small devices

152
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,720
and above.

153
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,950
So now if we open this up
on a medium-sized device

154
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:36,680
or a small device, we'll
see that our featured items

155
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,900
no longer have that
offset added to them.

156
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,090
The grid sizes we've
worked with so far

157
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:47,100
will work for almost every
situation you'll encounter.

158
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,590
But if you want to design
for a very, very large screen,

159
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,190
like a great big
monitor, you might

160
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,150
want to use the large
grid size, which

161
00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:00,520
will work for screen sizes
of 1,200 pixels and above.

162
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,110
There's only a few
other changes we

163
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,785
want to make in this section.

164
00:08:03,785 --> 00:08:05,880
The first of which
is that we only

165
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,560
want this image to show for
medium and large resolutions.

166
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,590
So what can we do to
make that happen?

167
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:18,200
If we want to hide an element
in one or more screen sizes,

168
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,320
Bootstrap has a couple of
classes that can help us out.

169
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,660
Let's take a look at those.

170
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,980
In this case, we want
to hide this image only

171
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,180
in small and extra-small mode.

172
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,460
To do that, we're going to
add a class of hidden-sm

173
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,580
and hidden-xs to this element.

174
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,419
This will hide it in small
and extra-small modes.

175
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:41,870
If we wanted to hide this
element in other screen sizes,

176
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,660
Bootstrap has some other classes
to help out with that as well.

177
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,670
If we check out our
page in a small device,

178
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,870
we will see the image is hidden.

179
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,840
The same goes for an
extra-small device.

180
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,250
On the other hand, what if
instead of hiding something,

181
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,890
we wanted to only show something
for certain screen sizes?

182
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:10,190
Well, to do that we could use
these visible-md and visible-lg

183
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,450
classes.

184
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:15,430
This will only show our image
for medium and large screen

185
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,360
sizes.

186
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,120
You'll notice each
of these classes ends

187
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:27,310
with a screen size indicator,
like sm, xs, md, and lg.

188
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,150
If we open this up
in a browser, we'll

189
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:34,310
see that our image shows up
in medium and large devices.

190
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,950
But in small and
extra-small, it's

191
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,830
hidden just like
we'd expect it to be.

192
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,690
That's the end of
Responsive Gridding.

193
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,300
It's time for you to try
using it in the challenges,

194
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,660
and I'll see you in level three.

195
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,480
Then, we'll need to give—

196
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,790
We got too many columns!
