1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,840
Welcome back to Blasting
Off with Bootstrap.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,970
This is level four, section
two — Navigating Navigation.

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:13,830
So far, the only way to
navigate between pages

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,060
is that list of links way
down there in the footer

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,510
that very few people
will ever see.

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,290
In this section,
we'll be working

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,430
on adding a navigation
bar at the top of our page

8
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,430
that we can use instead.

9
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,480
So here's what we'll be
building in this section.

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,800
We want the title of our
page to really stand out,

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,810
and we want our
most important links

12
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:40,150
to be easily accessible
at the top of our page.

13
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,260
Just as a refresher, here's
our current page header

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,050
that we'll be working with.

15
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,350
We'll be replacing this
entire row with a navigation

16
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,200
bar using Bootstrap.

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,120
One major difference
for our navigation

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,050
is that we will no longer
be using a grid system.

19
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,770
Because of that, we
can remove our row

20
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,690
and our col-md-12
elements altogether.

21
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,320
So why aren't we
using a grid here?

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,490
Well, we'll want the
width of the elements

23
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,080
in our navigation to be
determined by their content

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,640
rather than by a grid system.

25
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,450
We'll see how that
will allow us to build

26
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:21,180
a more flexible navigation
throughout this section.

27
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,070
To get our links ready
for our navigation bar,

28
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,750
we can copy them from our footer
and put them up here as well.

29
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,870
These are all links to
other pages in our site.

30
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,200
If you remember how our
footer looked when we first

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,580
looked at it, you might
have a guess as to what

32
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,200
our page looks like so far.

33
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,620
You can see that if
we preview our updated

34
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,610
page, our navigation
has those default bullet

35
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:48,190
icons next to them, kind of like
all unstyled, unordered lists do.

36
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,370
We will definitely work
on cleaning those up,

37
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,960
but first, let's get
that H1 converted to be

38
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,690
a link back to our home page.

39
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,550
Since we want this to be a link,
we can get rid of that H1 tag

40
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,940
that we added in
earlier and convert it

41
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,410
to a standard link
using an a tag.

42
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,230
Now that we've converted
this into a link that points

43
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,080
to our home page, we'll need
to add a class of navbar-brand

44
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,160
to it.

45
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,530
This class specifies
that the text or image

46
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,870
represents your brand and
will be positioned way over

47
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,270
to the left side of the page.

48
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,130
If we open this up
in a browser, we'll

49
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,710
see that we're making a
little bit of progress.

50
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,260
Our link element and our
navigation list element

51
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,840
are at least on the same line.

52
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,750
The navbar-brand class is
a great place for you to put

53
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,000
your site logo as well.

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,210
It's a common pattern that
the very top left corner

55
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,260
of your website links
back to your home page,

56
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,820
and it's where people will first
look when they visit your site.

57
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,320
Let's see what we
can do to clean up

58
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,850
our list of links next.

59
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:03,190
One very easy change we can
do is use Bootstrap's nav

60
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:08,150
component by adding a class
of nav to our ul element.

61
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,540
This nav class specifies
that the list items

62
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,240
within this entire
element are links,

63
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,300
and then styles
them accordingly.

64
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,210
In our case, they will still
appear next to our brand.

65
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,270
You might ask why the
beginning of our list

66
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,090
is still appearing on the
same line as our title.

67
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,680
Well, our list is still starting
at the same spot it was before.

68
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,730
But because of this nav
class, now all of our links

69
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,240
are being carried down
to following lines.

70
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,530
The nav class is similar
to btn or glyphicon.

71
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,980
It's a starting
point that we can

72
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,050
use to say, "We're going
to use a nav here."

73
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,970
We'll still need to
add another class

74
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:50,310
to let Bootstrap know what type
of navigation we want to use.

75
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,220
There are a few possible nav
modifiers available that we can

76
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,220
use throughout our page,
not just in our header.

77
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,900
The nav-pills is
a very common one

78
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,670
and will cause the links
to appear horizontally

79
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:07,756
with a nice padding around each
link with this cool border.

80
00:04:07,756 --> 00:04:12,040
The nav-tabs class handles
creating a tab navigation

81
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,420
bar where the content
below it could

82
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,430
be relevant to the active tab.

83
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:23,100
In this case, though, we want to
use the navbar-nav class, which

84
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,540
will cause our
unordered list of links

85
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,070
to appear inline horizontally,
kind of like nav-pills

86
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,300
but without the same
rounded borders.

87
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,360
Lastly, we want our
nav to be all the way

88
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,760
on the right side of
our page, separate

89
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,670
from our brand position.

90
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,790
To do that, we
can add in a class

91
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:46,370
of navbar-right, which will
position our nav way over here.

92
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,760
We can open this up in a
browser and see that we now

93
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,950
have a working navigation.

94
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:59,790
It's positioned correctly due
to that navbar-right class,

95
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,540
and the navbar-nav class even
adds some different background

96
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,850
colors when we hover
over each of those links.

97
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,870
Things are getting
there, but our navigation

98
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,970
is looking a little too close
to the rest of our page.

99
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:16,450
Our goal navigation looked quite a bit different.

100
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,145
Here's one more look at
where we're headed on this.

101
00:05:19,145 --> 00:05:21,520
This navigation has
a nice background

102
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,110
that stretches all the
way across the page,

103
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:27,110
as well as some more muted
colors for these links.

104
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,880
Let's see what we need to
do to get our page looking

105
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,730
a little bit more like this.

106
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,930
One simple but massive
change to our page

107
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,010
is changing this div
that we've been working

108
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:43,410
with into a navigation bar
using Bootstrap's navigation

109
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,190
component.

110
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,230
To do that, we can
add a class of navbar

111
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,540
to our div that contains our
brand and our list of links.

112
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,210
By itself, this
won't do too much.

113
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,440
It's similar to the btn
class that we used earlier.

114
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,740
In order to specify a color
scheme for our navigation bar,

115
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,640
we can add a class of
navbar-default to this element.

116
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,210
If we checked out our
navigation bar now,

117
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,070
we'd see that it has this nice
gray background with some muted

118
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,260
colors for our text as well.

119
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,040
Bootstrap has one other
navigation bar theme

120
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,820
called navbar-inverse, which is
great for darker color schemes.

121
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,830
Opening this up in
a browser, we can

122
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,230
see that our navigation
bar is styled correctly,

123
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,570
but it doesn't stretch all
the way across the page.

124
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,860
It's being centered,
like our content,

125
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,230
and looks very similar to
our well we added earlier.

126
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,900
What can we do to
make this stretch

127
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,500
all the way across the page?

128
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,270
The reason our
navigation bar shows up

129
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:49,570
like this is because its
width and its margins

130
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:53,330
are being set by the container
class, which keeps it centered

131
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,000
in the middle of the page.

132
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,870
What we really need
is for our navigation

133
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,230
to be separated
from our container.

134
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,290
Here's what the HTML
for our navigation

135
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,420
looks like right now.

136
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,110
We have one div that is
being centered, thanks

137
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,090
to our container class,
and has all the styles

138
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:15,180
for our navigation bar, thanks to our
other two navigation classes.

139
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,990
What we want, though,
is for our container

140
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,670
to be inside of
our navigation bar.

141
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:24,710
To do that, we'll need to go
ahead and create a new div that

142
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:29,200
will surround our container and
move our other two navigation

143
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,010
bar classes on to that new div.

144
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,350
Now, our gray styling
for our navigation bar

145
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,710
will stretch all the
way across the page,

146
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,530
but then the content
within that navigation bar,

147
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,200
it'll still be centered.

148
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,085
This will now look like
our goal navigation.

149
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,500
Bootstrap's navigation
component isn't required

150
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,380
to be at the top of the page.

151
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,420
Navigation bars
could be positioned

152
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,630
in the middle of a page
or even at the bottom.

153
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,800
The default navigation bar
will have four rounded corners

154
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,340
on it, kind of like our
well element earlier,

155
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,930
but we don't really
want that in our case.

156
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:09,740
To let Bootstrap know, we'll add
one more class to our navbar,

157
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,840
and that class is called
navbar-static-top.

158
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,190
This will let Bootstrap know
that this navigation bar should

159
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,800
be at the very top of our page.

160
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,950
As you might guess,
there's also a class

161
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,270
for positioning a navigation bar
at the very bottom of a page.

162
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,550
There's a few other classes
available for setting a fixed

163
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,309
position as well.

164
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:36,390
Fixed positions will always
be visible on the page,

165
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,100
so as you scroll,
the navigation bar

166
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,270
will always show up on top
of whatever other content is

167
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,890
on your page.

168
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,800
It's a bit tough to describe
these without an example,

169
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,510
so let's take a
look at what I mean.

170
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:54,740
Here's a navigation bar
using navbar-static-top.

171
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,080
As we scroll down the page,
the navigation bar goes away.

172
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,020
Static just means
that it's stationary,

173
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:07,230
and will scroll just like
the rest of our page content.

174
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,840
Now, if we change this up to be
using a navbar-fixed-top class

175
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,280
and then scroll down, we'd see
that the navigation bar still

176
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,210
shows up on top of the
rest of our content.

177
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,400
This would be useful if we
had a very long page that

178
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,930
had lots and lots of
content and always wanted

179
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,910
our navigation bar visible.

180
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,510
When using
navbar-fixed-top, you'll

181
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:33,160
also notice that our
navigation bar shows up on top

182
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,090
of the content that follows it.

183
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:38,000
To fix that, you'd want to
add a little bit of padding

184
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,760
to your body to help
counteract the overlap.

185
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,930
So we've talked quite a
lot about navbar and nav,

186
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,210
but what exactly is the
difference between them?

187
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:54,870
Well, think of the nav class
as being a very basic building

188
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,560
block of your entire site.

189
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,450
You might have multiple navs on
a page, or you might have a sub

190
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,700
nav that shows up
in your sidebar.

191
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,400
Each could use one of the
different nav styles that

192
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,450
Bootstrap provides.

193
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,550
For navbar, though, you
probably won't want to have

194
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,590
more than one of these
on your entire website.

195
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,670
You could if you wanted, but
that would most likely confuse

196
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,030
people.

197
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,830
That's about it for this
section and level four.

198
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,130
It's time for you to
navigate some navigation

199
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:28,500
in the challenges, and we'll
see you back in level five.

200
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,812
You to try navigating
navigation in the challenges.

201
00:10:32,812 --> 00:10:34,020
That's the name of the level.

202
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,540
Time for you to try
navigating navigations —

203
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,810
Time for you to try navigating some
navigation in the challenges,

204
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,870
and we'll see you back —

205
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,765
I can't do it.

206
00:10:41,765 --> 00:10:44,590
For you to navigate
some navigation —
