00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:03,810
as you please.

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,710
Easy as slicing cheese,
with the tools such as these.

00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,970
Structure pages quick.
No CSS to make you sick.

Use the layout that you pick.
Navigation helps you click.

00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,379
Icon and buttons you can tap.
Your containers close the gap.

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,190
Responsive gridding is a snap.

00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:24,072
You'll be launching off the map,
blasting off with Bootstrap.

Blasting Off with Bootstrap.

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,920
Welcome back to Blasting
Off with Bootstrap.

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,450
This is level four, section one —
Enough CSS to be Dangerous.

12
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,720
Our page is coming together.

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,640
But let's see what we can
do to make it even better.

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,350
In this section, we'll
add a dash of style

15
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,520
using more Bootstrap
awesomeness.

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,270
To start out, we'll
focus on what's

17
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,960
above the fold: our
lead and these buttons,

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,330
which are kind of our main call
to action on the entire page.

19
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,041
Let's see what we
can do to encourage

20
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:59,040
people to click on them.

21
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,580
Here's the section of our page
that we'll be looking at.

22
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,970
This row contains a header,
our lead text, the buttons,

23
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,700
and that image that only shows
up for those larger screens.

24
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,270
This entire row could stand
out quite a bit more, though.

25
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,190
One way to make
this stand out more

26
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,170
is to use Bootstrap's
well class, which

27
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,630
will give it a nice inset effect
to the entire element row.

28
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,380
If we check this out in the browser,

29
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,200
we'll see that there's a background on this element now,

30
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,294
but also a border with rounded corners around it.

31
00:01:36,294 --> 00:01:37,210
It's not a bad change

32
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,800
for just adding one little class.

33
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,020
To make it stand
out even more, we

34
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,360
could specify a bit more
padding within the element

35
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,350
by adding a well-lg class to it.

36
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,580
The only thing this will do
is add a touch more padding

37
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,790
within our element to
make it slightly larger.

38
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,170
Since this is our main
focus of the page,

39
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,740
using this well-lg class
makes a lot of sense here.

40
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,370
Similarly, if part of our
page needed a little bit

41
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:08,550
less padding, we could
use the well-sm class

42
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,460
to decrease the amount of padding around the well.

43
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,630
We can open this up
in a browser and see

44
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,840
that our section
definitely stands out

45
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,950
much more than it did before.

46
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,660
The background color
and rounded border

47
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,140
are a clean addition
to our page.

48
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,210
Those buttons are
starting to seem

49
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,750
like they don't
belong on our page.

50
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,320
Kind of ugly, right?

51
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,280
Let's work on improving
those guys next.

52
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,090
Here's the HTML for
our buttons so far.

53
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,090
These are functional, but they
will look slightly different

54
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,530
in all browsers.

55
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,310
In order to let Bootstrap
style these buttons so

56
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,590
that they look the
same for all browsers,

57
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,860
we'll need to add a class
of btn to our buttons.

58
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,870
If you looked at them now,
they look completely different.

59
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,620
They have some
padding around them,

60
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,930
and there's this
nice gray background.

61
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,510
However, nothing happens
when you mouse over them,

62
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,810
making it really tough to tell
if these buttons are working.

63
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,630
They're also a little
bit small for being

64
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,940
such an important
part of our page.

65
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,160
What can we do to fix that?

66
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,710
To increase their size, we can
add another Bootstrap class

67
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:23,580
of btn-lg to both of
these button elements.

68
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,210
This will cause these buttons
to show up with a larger font

69
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,030
and add a little bit
more padding to them.

70
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,470
There are a few other button
sizes that we can use as well,

71
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,230
including btn-xs,
btn-sm, and btn-lg.

72
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,090
These sizes should be
a little bit familiar

73
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,040
because they're the
same sizes that we

74
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,560
used for all of our grids.

75
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,540
The same way we
started by designing

76
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,140
for medium-sized screens,
that's the default for buttons

77
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,030
as well.

78
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,460
If you don't specify
a button size,

79
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,800
you can assume it will
just use the medium size.

80
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,540
One important thing
here is that we're again

81
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,340
adding multiple
classes to our button.

82
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,030
This is similar to how we
added multiple classes when

83
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,520
we were working with
glyphicons earlier.

84
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,140
Each additional class adds
unique style to our buttons,

85
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,220
combining them to create
our intended appearance.

86
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,040
Gray buttons that
don't change colors

87
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,149
don't do much for
the imagination.

88
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,850
Let's go ahead and add some
additional button classes

89
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,190
to specify a color for
both of our buttons.

90
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,140
For our Take the
Tour button, we're

91
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:31,040
going to use the btn-default
class, indicating

92
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,240
that this is a normal
button on our page

93
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,380
without any additional
meaning to it.

94
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,240
Our Book Tickets Now
button, though, well, that's

95
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,700
actually the primary
action on our page

96
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,120
that we want everyone to click
when they come to our site.

97
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,560
For that one, we'll add a
class of btn-primary to it.

98
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,180
Now if we check these
out in the browser,

99
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,630
we'll see the Tour button
has this white background,

100
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,250
while the Book Tickets
Now button adds

101
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,280
the first real touch of
color to our page, which

102
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,270
will immediately
draw attention to it.

103
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,380
We're not limited to white
and blue button backgrounds,

104
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,310
though.

105
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,610
Bootstrap provides a
handful of other colors

106
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,970
that we can work with.

107
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,350
These button styles aren't
characterized by their colors,

108
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,800
but rather based
on their intention.

109
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,930
For instance, if you had
a button on your page

110
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,920
to launch RocketBus,
we probably want

111
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,510
it to use the btn-danger
class because that

112
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,780
is a potentially
dangerous action.

113
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,680
Likewise, if you wanted
people to feel comfortable

114
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,190
placing an order, we might
add a btn-success class

115
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,120
to our Form Submit.

116
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,132
Alright, we've done
a few cool things.

117
00:05:38,132 --> 00:05:39,590
Let's check out
what our page looks

118
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,150
like in a few
different resolutions.

119
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,500
Well, you can see
that in small mode,

120
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,750
our well is attractive
and stands out

121
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,260
and our buttons look plenty
big to draw attention.

122
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,900
Additionally, if we
shrink the browser down

123
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,560
to extra-small mode, the
well stretches all the way

124
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,340
across the page without
that same white background

125
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,850
showing on each side of it.

126
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,580
And so you've reached
the end of this section.

127
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,080
It's time for you
to see if you know

128
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,000
enough CSS to be dangerous
in the challenges.

129
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,890
And I'll see you
back in section two.
