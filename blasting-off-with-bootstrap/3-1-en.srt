Use the layout that you pick.
Navigation helps you click.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,400
Icons and buttons you can tap.
Your containers close the gap.

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,200
Responsive gridding is a snap.

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:24,272
You'll be launching off the map,
blasting off with Bootstrap.

9
00:00:24,272 --> 00:00:25,970
Blasting Off with Bootstrap.

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,360
Welcome back to Blasting
Off with Bootstrap.

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,040
This is level three — Typography.

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,730
So what exactly is typography?

13
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,050
Well, Wikipedia defines it
as, "The art and technique

14
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,740
of arranging text on the page
to make it most appealing."

15
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,730
In the web world, when
we talk about typography,

16
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,700
we're generally concerned
with fonts, including

17
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,780
what font, the size,
the position, color,

18
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,960
and how to make
them work together.

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,020
If we take a look
at our page so far,

20
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,550
we'll see that it's not using
the default browser font.

21
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,940
That's because this
bootstrap.css file

22
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,920
that we included, well,
it overrides all the fonts

23
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,430
used on our page.

24
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,380
If you're familiar with
CSS, this style definition

25
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,930
will shed a little light on
what Bootstrap is doing for us.

26
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,840
There's a lot going on here,
including changing the font

27
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,350
to use this Helvetica
Neue typeface.

28
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,010
And it's also changing
the default size, and even

29
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,000
the color to this kind
of neutral gray, which

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,500
is a lot easier on the eyes.

31
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,530
Now all of those
styles, they're being

32
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,480
applied to our entire
page, but any of them

33
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,950
can also be overridden.

34
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:37,280
For instance, our H1 tag,
well, it isn't 14 pixels.

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,150
We overrode that font
size by using a tag, H1,

36
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,510
that is setting the
font size larger.

37
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,750
Using tags is one way to
override Bootstrap styles.

38
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,940
But there's another way using
some typography CSS classes

39
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,570
that Bootstrap provides.

40
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,800
Let's see how it can
make our lead text

41
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,850
stand out a little bit more
by using one of these classes.

42
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,000
Here's the relevant
part of our page,

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,380
the paragraph just
below our H2 tag

44
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,710
where we describe our company.

45
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,160
This sentence isn't
a header, but we

46
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,950
do want to make it stand out
more than the other sentences

47
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,050
on the page.

48
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:18,700
To do that, we'll add the class
of lead to this paragraph tag.

49
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,720
This will actually increase
the font size and the weight,

50
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,010
but it will also add
a little more space

51
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,600
around the element,
kind of giving it

52
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
a little breathing room.

53
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,760
If we compare our paragraph
tag without using lead,

54
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,820
and with it, they do
seem kind of similar.

55
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,300
The font size for
our lead paragraph

56
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,400
is 50% larger, though,
making it stand out

57
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,760
compared to all of the other
paragraphs on our page.

58
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,400
Another characteristic
of good typography

59
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,360
involves font alignment.

60
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,400
Now Bootstrap has
a couple of classes

61
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,570
that can help us
with that as well.

62
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,220
Let's take a look at
our featured items

63
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,240
to see how it could
help us there.

64
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,220
Hm.

65
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,340
They're okay.

66
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,110
And it's nice that our "Book
Today!" element is centered.

67
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,790
But what if the text within
them was also centered?

68
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,400
Let's give it a try and see
what that would look like.

69
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,950
Here's our div row for
our three featured items.

70
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,560
We'll try centering all
text within this row.

71
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,940
In order to do that, we'll
use a text alignment class

72
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:27,770
for a row, which will affect
all of the text within that row.

73
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,990
In this case, we want
to center the text.

74
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,500
So we'll add a class of
text center to the div.

75
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,890
Well, what if we had only
wanted to center the H3 tag?

76
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:40,190
Well, we could have added a text
center class to that element

77
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,410
instead.

78
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,925
In this case, though, by
adding the class here,

79
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:46,980
it will center all
the headers and all

80
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,290
of the paragraphs
within this row.

81
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,020
Additionally, Bootstrap has
a few other alignment classes

82
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,730
that can help us out for
aligning left or right,

83
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,360
or even justifying text,
which spaces your text out

84
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,950
so it's flush against both
the right and the left sides

85
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,130
of the screen.

86
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,520
Let's open our new design up in
a browser and see how it looks.

87
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,360
Nice.

88
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,120
All the elements in
the row are being

89
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,670
centered by adding
just that one class.

90
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,279
Each is being centered
within its element,

91
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:19,010
using the full number of
columns available to it.

92
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,900
But since we got rid of
that image in small and

93
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,440
extra-small mode, this
page is looking a bit bare.

94
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,862
What if we added some icons that
show up next to our features

95
00:04:28,862 --> 00:04:29,820
to really draw the eye?

96
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,570
Usually that would mean going
out to search for some images,

97
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,560
right, making sure that
they're legal to use,

98
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,150
adding in image tags, and
generally a lot more work.

99
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,530
Let's see what that process
is if we're using Bootstrap.

100
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,930
Remember this font folder
that came with Bootstrap?

101
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,320
Well, this is actually an
entire library of icons.

102
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,190
If you think about it,
a font is a mapping

103
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,460
from a character code
to some font image.

104
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,760
Code 41 might be a capital A in
fonts like Helvetica and Times

105
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,720
New Roman, but in this
cool glyphicon font,

106
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,740
code 41 might map to a tag
image or a profile image.

107
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,560
We don't need to
know which codes map

108
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,160
to which icons to
use them, luckily.

109
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,390
Bootstrap provides CSS classes
that we can add to our HTML

110
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,990
when we need to use these icons.

111
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,380
This glyphicon library —
which you would usually

112
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,870
have to pay for separately —
is actually free with Bootstrap,

113
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,800
and contains 200
icons you can use.

114
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,000
Oh, and if you're
wondering why there's so

115
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,330
many fonts in this folder,
well, blame web browsers.

116
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:39,270
The .woff file — or
web open font format —

117
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,230
is now used by all
modern web browsers.

118
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,050
But there's a few
fallbacks in there

119
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,260
for older versions
of Internet Explorer

120
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,520
and a few other special cases.

121
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,180
So how do we go about
using these icons?

122
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,960
In our case, we want this
icon to show up right

123
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,810
above our "Book Today!" header.

124
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,560
To add an icon,
we'll need an element

125
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,690
to which to attach a class.

126
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,306
We'll use an i element for this.

127
00:06:06,306 --> 00:06:10,230
This element was originally
used for italic text,

128
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,840
but it's become a
standard practice

129
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,000
to use it for icons as well.

130
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,890
We need this element to use the
glyphicons font, rather than

131
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,910
that Helvetica Neue font,
like the rest of our page.

132
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:24,140
To do that, we'll add in
a class of glyphicon

133
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,630
to this element.

134
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,750
If we open this up
and view it now,

135
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,865
we're not really
seeing anything.

136
00:06:29,865 --> 00:06:32,010
In order for an icon
to show up, we'll

137
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:37,730
still need to specify
which icon we want to use.

138
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,340
Our paragraph here
is all about travel.

139
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,220
So we'll go ahead and add
a briefcase icon here,

140
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,740
since it kind of
resembles luggage.

141
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,180
To do that, we'll add the
glyphicon briefcase class

142
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,780
to our i element.

143
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,550
This is a pattern you'll
see very often in Bootstrap —

144
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,620
applying two classes to
accomplish a single task.

145
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,980
This helps keep the Bootstrap
CSS file much smaller.

146
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,330
In this case, the
glyphicon class

147
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,960
is what's setting the
font family we'll use,

148
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,080
while the glyphicon briefcase
class, that is actually

149
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,290
specifying which
icon we can use.

150
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:17,290
Let's go ahead and add icons
to our other featured items.

151
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,920
We'll follow the same
pattern as before,

152
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,690
creating an i element
for "Go Anywhere",

153
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,030
and give it a
class of glyphicon.

154
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,660
If we head over to the
Bootstrap web page,

155
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,460
we can pick out
another icon and find

156
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,260
the associated class for it.

157
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,350
In this case, I'm going to add
the glyphicon random class,

158
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,520
which creates this
crossed paths icon.

159
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,760
For our "RocketBus", we'll
follow the same pattern again

160
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,290
and pick out an icon.

161
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,130
There is no rocket
icon, unfortunately.

162
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,540
But this paper plane icon
conveys a similar meaning.

163
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,260
Now, if we really
needed a rocket icon,

164
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,480
we could go find
another library that

165
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,210
provides additional
icons, like Font Awesome.

166
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,160
I'm okay with our plane
icon for now, though,

167
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,564
so let's stick with it.

168
00:08:02,564 --> 00:08:03,980
Let's see what our
page looks like

169
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,100
with these shiny new icons.

170
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,290
So we're all excited to see
our new icons in action.

171
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,250
So we open up a new
page in a browser

172
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,530
and, oh no, they turned
out much smaller

173
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,240
than we might have expected.

174
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,830
How do we increase the
font size of these icons?

175
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,000
Well, if these were
images, we could just

176
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,600
set the height and width
on them, and we'd be fine.

177
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,360
But that won't
work in this case.

178
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,320
Remember earlier on we mentioned
how Bootstrap sets the default

179
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,010
font size of our
page to 14 pixels.

180
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,980
Well, it turns out that's also
setting the size of our icons,

181
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,760
since they're also a font.

182
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,870
But the good news
is we can override

183
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,140
the font size of
our icons by adding

184
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,600
a very small amount of CSS
and increasing the font size.

185
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,770
Let's give it a shot.

186
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:54,560
First, we don't want to be
editing the bootstrap.css file.

187
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,840
If we ever wanted
to update Bootstrap,

188
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,270
we don't want any of our
custom changes to be in there.

189
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:05,270
Instead, we'll add another link
to a new main.css file, which

190
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,220
we'll create all of
our customizations.

191
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:16,190
Next, we'll add one additional
class to our row of features.

192
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,520
And we'll call it
Features, of course.

193
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,140
This could be whatever you want.

194
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,940
It's not a class provided
by Bootstrap, right?

195
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,440
We just need some
way of identifying

196
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,300
this section of the page.

197
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:32,960
Then we can create
this css/main.css file,

198
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,060
and define a single CSS
selector of .features.glyphicon.

199
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,470
This just means that we'll
only be styling glyphicons that

200
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,120
are inside of an element
with a class of features.

201
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,900
In this case, we'll increase
the font size to 32 pixels,

202
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,620
making them stand
out quite a bit

203
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,420
from their surrounding text.

204
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,950
It's important to note here that
if we left out the .features

205
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:03,980
part, we would be styling
all glyphicons on the page.

206
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,370
At the moment, that
would be okay, but it's

207
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:11,450
a best practice to only
style what you need.

208
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,380
Alright.

209
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,520
So now we can open
this up in a browser

210
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,760
and see that our icons
are looking great.

211
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,660
They're big enough to add
some distinction to our page,

212
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,940
but also space it out, adding
a little more breathing room.

213
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,500
Now because these
icons are a font,

214
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,130
there's some nifty
customizations

215
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,590
we can do with them.

216
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,910
Let's check a few of those out.

217
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,040
If our page had a
different color scheme

218
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,610
or had a dark background,
then having these dark icons

219
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,450
wouldn't really work, right?

220
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,700
We can set the color of
these icons in the same way

221
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,520
that we'd set any font color,
and affect all of the icons

222
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,190
on the page at once.

223
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,760
For our icons though,
we're OK with them matching

224
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,980
the default font
color of the page.

225
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:55,740
So we won't be changing
them to red right now.

226
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,650
One part of the page that we
haven't looked into just yet

227
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,890
is the footer.

228
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,960
This is where we'll have a few
links to the rest of our site,

229
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,860
a brief description
of our company,

230
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,720
and some ways of
getting in touch.

231
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,560
But what about those
bullets next to Links?

232
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,510
They really stand out.

233
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,530
That's the default
browser behavior

234
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,360
when you use an unordered list.

235
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,037
But it's not really
what we want.

236
00:11:17,037 --> 00:11:19,245
Let's check out how to get
rid of those bullet icons.

237
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,450
Here's what the code for
this section of our footer

238
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,650
looks like.

239
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:29,220
We have an H4 for
our links, and a ul,

240
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,410
which contains a
few of these links.

241
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:36,290
By default, ul elements will
add a list style CSS property,

242
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,080
which adds in
these little bullet

243
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,370
icons and a little
bit of spacing.

244
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,280
We can remove both
of these additions

245
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,650
by changing the style
of our ul element.

246
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,740
To do that, we'll
go ahead and add

247
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,520
a class of list-unstyled
to our ul element.

248
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,030
This is a Bootstrap
class that will not only

249
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,540
remove those bullet
icons that we don't need,

250
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,370
it will also get
rid of those margins

251
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,930
that were messing up our look.

252
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,710
Bootstrap has another
list class that's helpful

253
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:08,150
called list-inline, which
will do the same thing as

254
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:12,590
list-unstyled, but also causes
the li elements to show up

255
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,505
horizontally rather
than vertically.

256
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,050
To check out our
finished footer,

257
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,580
we'll open this
page up in a browser

258
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:24,280
and see that our page is
starting to really take shape.

259
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,780
Our bullet icons are all
gone from the footer,

260
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,360
making it much easier to read.

261
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,700
Besides that, the
icons that we added,

262
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,290
and that lead text,
all help to make

263
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:37,230
different parts of
our page stand out.

264
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,796
And that is the end of level three.

265
00:12:39,796 --> 00:12:41,170
It's time for you
to see what you

266
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,540
know about typography
in the challenges.

267
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,830
And I'll see you
back for level four.

268
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:51,320
This element was originally —
a little drunk there.
