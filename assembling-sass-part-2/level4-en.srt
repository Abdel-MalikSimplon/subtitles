[SINGING]

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,500
Your style sheets are bloated
and making a mess.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,195
Your HTML is ashamed
of your CSS.

4
00:00:08,195 --> 00:00:10,960
It's not organized and
it's not classy.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,620
It's time to make your
style sheets sassy.

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,318
Using CSS extensions
are the preference.

7
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:21,190
We'll use mixins, nesting
and inheritance.

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,160
Functions extend and partials
we'll amass.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,150
In no time you'll be
assembling Sass.

10
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,560
You're watching level
four, rhythm.

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,910
In this level, we're going to be
going through the Vertical

12
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,050
Rhythm module of Sass and the
various ins and outs of how to

13
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,020
use its mixins.

14
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,910
In dealing with grids on the
web, most of us are familiar

15
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,560
with horizontal grids like the
one that Susy provides.

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,370
Will go into Susy in the
wrap-up, but it's a compass

17
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,840
and Sass extension for dealing
with layouts like this.

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,700
In this level, though, we're
talking about vertical grids,

19
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,290
or baseline grids.

20
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,910
Ultimately, we're going to be
working towards something like

21
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,620
this, a very simple set
of text styling.

22
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,840
And when we overlay a baseline
grid, we can see that

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,470
everything in this text
styling aligns

24
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,360
to that grid properly.

25
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,115
We're going to start with
this bit of HTML, one h1,

26
00:01:18,115 --> 00:01:20,700
a couple paragraphs,
and a block quote.

27
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,980
Without some sort of baseline
grid, we might style this

28
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,110
using a set of magic numbers and
eyeballing different sorts

29
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,320
of margins.

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,700
If we look back at our content
with this style applied, it

31
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,440
might look something
like this.

32
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,980
This isn't bad, but it doesn't
really conform

33
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,490
to any sort of rhythm.

34
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,540
If we overlay a baseline grid,
we can see that the elements

35
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,420
don't fall into any sort
of organization.

36
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,390
We're going to use Compass to
add a baseline grid for us and

37
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,650
allow it to manage all of the
alignment and margins and

38
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,220
padding for us.

39
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,240
And so initially we're going to
start with just a reset of

40
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,310
our content, which looks
something like this.

41
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,420
Then, to start using the
Vertical Rhythm module, we

42
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,260
have to set a few global
variables.

43
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,965
First up, we'll establish our
base font size and our base

44
00:02:08,965 --> 00:02:13,310
line height, and then use the
establish-baseline mixin

45
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,640
which outputs some CSS like
this, ultimately changing our

46
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,660
output to look like this.

47
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:25,420
Now we have a base font size set
and our baseline grid is

48
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,680
in place with all the line
heights matching.

49
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,350
With our baseline grid started,
let's start adjusting

50
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,550
font sizes and leading.

51
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,730
Because of the relative line
heights to keep our vertical

52
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,540
rhythm going, if we try to
change the font size in a

53
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,710
normal way, it's going to throw
off our vertical rhythm.

54
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:48,570
So in order to change font size
while using it, we can

55
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:52,540
use the adjust font size
to mixin like so.

56
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,770
Here we're going to change
the font size of

57
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,480
our h1 to 50 pixels.

58
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,540
And the output will go ahead
and figure out the relative

59
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,540
unit to match up for us.

60
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,550
Now we can see our h1 has been
increased to the relative unit

61
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,810
for 50 pixels, and it still
conforms to our baseline grid.

62
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,230
Let's talk a bit about
typography for a moment.

63
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:22,030
Leading is the
distance between our baseline

64
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,430
grid units.

65
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,050
Back when type was handset, they
would take strips of lead

66
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,820
to help separate out
the lines of text.

67
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,450
So we continue this function in
our vertical rhythm grid.

68
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,570
To determine the number of units
a single line of text

69
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,040
should use up, we can
adjust our leading.

70
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,200
So we're going to adjust the
leading of our block

71
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,750
quote to two units.

72
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,250
And with the leading adjusted
on our block quote, it now

73
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,570
takes up two units of vertical
space with the text vertically

74
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,000
centered within.

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,600
It's important to note that when
we're dealing with our

76
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,610
vertical rhythm mixins, if we
adjust the base font size for

77
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,920
that unit, we usually need to
tell that mixin that the font

78
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,350
size has changed.

79
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,310
Otherwise, it tries to calculate
any relative units

80
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,770
based on our base font
size variable.

81
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,690
Here, if we adjust the font size
of our block quote to 20

82
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,270
pixels and take a look at the
output again, we can see that

83
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,810
it's been thrown slightly off.

84
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,210
We have to go back to our adjust
leading to mixin and

85
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,910
include a second argument of
that adjusted font size.

86
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,720
And our output is now fixed and
calculated correctly to

87
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,970
compensate.

88
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,950
As you might have noticed,
there's a bit of extra CSS

89
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,530
that's being output.

90
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,760
Since we're adjusting the font
size, it's outputting an

91
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,700
adjusted line height for us.

92
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,880
And then when we change the
leading, it outputs another

93
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,180
line height change on
our block quote.

94
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,710
Because of the way the Vertical
Rhythm module works,

95
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,180
there's no way to stop these
overriding properties from

96
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,770
being output so you need to
make sure that any use of

97
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,930
these mixins is deliberate to
keep your CSS from being

98
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:10,150
bloated with overuse of these
sorts of properties.

99
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,910
Finally, let's wrap up by
showing how we can change

100
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,420
margin, padding and borders
without affecting

101
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,110
our baseline grid.

102
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,450
To add margins to the top or
bottom of elements, we can use

103
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:24,590
the leader and trailer mixins,
like the one unit of leader

104
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,522
and trailer we're adding
to our paragraph.

105
00:05:26,522 --> 00:05:30,180
Now our output shows a one unit
margin above and below

106
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,430
every paragraph.

107
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,510
Just like our just leading to
mixin, if we change the base

108
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,830
font size on an element, we need
to notify our leaders or

109
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,680
trailers of that change.

110
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,290
If we add a two unit trailer
to our h1, we need to make

111
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,530
sure we pass as a second
argument that 50 pixel

112
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,720
adjusted font size so that our
output keeps the baseline grid

113
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,880
going correctly.

114
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,970
Here's what this looks like now
with a two unit trailer.

115
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,890
There are other mixins given to
us by Compass for dealing

116
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,530
with vertical rhythm, including
padding leader and

117
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,710
padding trailer.

118
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,830
Both of these work the same way
as leader and trailer but

119
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,880
output a padding
value instead.

120
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,950
If we have to use a combination
of leaders,

121
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,120
trailers, and padding leaders
and trailers, we can combine

122
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,670
everything using the
rhythm mixin.

123
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,290
The rhythm mixin takes arguments
including the

124
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:28,900
leader, padding leader, padding
trailer, trailer, and

125
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,660
the adjusted font size, if
necessary, to combine and

126
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,720
output all those properties.

127
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,340
Be careful in your
use of rhythm.

128
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,270
If you don't need all these
values and you include zeros,

129
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,530
it's going to output properties
in your CSS with a

130
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,750
zero that you might not need.

131
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,700
The final property that throws
off our baseline grid and

132
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,040
styles is border.

133
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,520
So if we add a standard bottom
border to our h1 element and

134
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,735
look at the output,
our baseline grid

135
00:06:54,735 --> 00:06:55,985
has been thrown off.

136
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,300
To add a border that doesn't
mess with our grid, we can

137
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,820
either use the leading border
or trailing border mixins.

138
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,750
Here we'll add trailing
border.

139
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,310
The first argument is the
width we'd like of

140
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,550
the border, 10 pixels.

141
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,320
The second argument is the
padding we'd like between the

142
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,000
border and the element,
one unit.

143
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,690
And the adjusted font size,
if necessary, which

144
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,130
it is in this case.

145
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,450
So if we look back at our
output, our h1 now has a

146
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,750
border on the bottom and
our grid is maintained.

147
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,300
If we'd like to add a border to
all sides of an element, as

148
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,370
well as the white space around
all sides of that element as

149
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,120
well, we can use
rhythm borders.

150
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,730
So the rhythm borders mixin
takes the width of the border

151
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,290
as the first argument as well,
then the amount of white space

152
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,840
in units, one here, and
then the adjusted

153
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,590
font size, if necessary.

154
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,330
So now our block quote has a
two pixel relative border

155
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:59,230
around it and equal
white space of

156
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,575
one unit on all sides.

157
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,330
As a recap, here's all
the code we've

158
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,120
written in this level.

159
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,210
As you can see, we've styled our
text without writing any

160
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,860
normal CSS.

161
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,140
Everything is mixins that are
handled through our Vertical

162
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,390
Rhythm module.

163
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,200
Baseline grids are difficult
to maintain on the web,

164
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,490
especially when it comes to
adding images and especially

165
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,410
design elements.

166
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:29,070
Just because these things might
throw off your grid,

167
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,660
something is better
than nothing.

168
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,450
And if you're interested in
tools to help you maintain

169
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,289
your vertical rhythm despite
images, we'll go into a few of

170
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:38,220
those things in the wrap-up.

171
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,659
That does it for level four.

172
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,860
So you're on the next
set of challenges.

173
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,250
We'll see you back here for
the final level, five.

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,359
