[SINGING]

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:04,500
Your style sheets are bloated
and making a mess.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,500
Your HTML is ashamed
of your CSS.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,960
It's not organized, and
it's not classy.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,620
It's time to make your
style sheets Sassy.

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,312
Using CSS extensions are the
preference, well it makes

7
00:00:18,312 --> 00:00:21,190
stems nest in an inheritance.

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,160
Functions extend and partials
we'll amass.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,150
In no time you'll be
assembling Sass.

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,150
Welcome to the final level,
Level Five, Sprites.

11
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,580
In this level, we're going to
talk a bit about spriting and

12
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,750
how Compass can make it much,
much easier on us.

13
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,920
Back in CSS Cross-Country, we
talked a bit about how we can

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,740
set up sprites and why
they're useful.

15
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,950
It combines a lot of images
into one, large image.

16
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,580
And then we use background
position to position that

17
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,250
image within an element
correctly so that we're only

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,400
seeing the part that we need.

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,510
This reduces the number
of HTTP requests.

20
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,220
And it's a very good
practice, but it's

21
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,510
not universally loved.

22
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,510
It's usually seen as a really
tedious process, and we

23
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,580
usually resort to third-party
tools to help us manage our

24
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,580
sprites for us.

25
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,850
There are a lot of really large
sites that make use of

26
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,000
sprites, like YouTube's
sheet right here.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,620
In dealing with background
images in your CSS, always

28
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,180
make sure you're using
the correct solution.

29
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,720
Sprites, icon fonts, embedded
images all have their

30
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,700
advantages and disadvantages,
so choose appropriately for

31
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,470
your project.

32
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,080
Throughout the level,
we're going to be

33
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,630
using these three images.

34
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:47,050
They'll all be inside a
subdirectory of our Images

35
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,770
folder, Icons.

36
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,780
And they're all at different
sizes, making spriting a bit

37
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,290
more difficult when
done manually.

38
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,810
To automatically sprite these
using Compass, we're going to

39
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,940
use @import in a new way.

40
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:05,180
We can import the items in the
Icons folder using the

41
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,259
asterisk to pull all pngs, and
this is going to create the

42
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,850
sprite for us, which looks
something like this.

43
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,180
The file will be added to the
Images folder, then it's going

44
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,770
to include a long string
after a hyphen.

45
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,710
You won't need to worry about
that because we're always

46
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,820
going to let Compass figure
out what the images and

47
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,550
include it into our style
sheet for us.

48
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,820
Once we've used this @import to
create our sprite, we can

49
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,460
automatically set up all
these sprites using the

50
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,460
all-icons-sprites mixin.

51
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,840
Now icons in this case refers to
the folder in which all of

52
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,430
our icons are found.

53
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,180
If all of your icons were in a
separate folder, you'd need to

54
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,990
change this name.

55
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,080
So when this runs, it outputs
all of this CSS for us,

56
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,830
automatically setting up classes
based on the file

57
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,670
names of our icons, and creating
separate classes to

58
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,080
set the background position
of each of those icons.

59
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,150
So this might be what you need
for your projects, but there's

60
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,490
a few problems.

61
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:08,320
Up first is creating a chain
of classes for all of the

62
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,660
icons that we have.

63
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,640
So the larger our style sheet
becomes, the larger that chain

64
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,820
of selectors becomes.

65
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,920
Also, while it outputs the
background position for us, it

66
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,850
doesn't set a height and
a width for that class.

67
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,940
So we have to go ahead and
manually figure that out and

68
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,890
set it later if we want to use
the sprite correctly and only

69
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,630
show that bit of the image.

70
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:34,940
To combat that, we're going to
set up sprites manually.

71
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,640
To start a manual set up,
we're going to use the

72
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,760
sprite-map function and
set it equal to a

73
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,580
variable called icons.

74
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,840
We use this same argument in
sprite-map that we used in

75
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,080
import to go ahead and
set up that sprite.

76
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,940
However, unlike import, it's
not going to go ahead and

77
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,830
create that image for us yet.

78
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,380
With that ready, we're going
to do something similar to

79
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,260
Twitter Bootstrap, and we're
going to use the i element as

80
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,870
the main HTML element for
all of our icons.

81
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,330
That allows us to set the
background of i to be our

82
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,440
sprite and not be required
to create a long chain of

83
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,910
selectors, like the automatic
version that might get too large

84
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,769
if we have a large amount
of sprites.

85
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:22,730
Once we set the background of
our i element to be the icons

86
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,810
variable that stores our
sprite-map, then the image is

87
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,810
created in the Images directory,
just like our old

88
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,160
@import in the automatic
method.

89
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,550
And it's automatically
added as the

90
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,460
background of the i element.

91
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,610
With that set, we need to start

92
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,930
building out our sprites.

93
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:45,450
So we're going to manually
create an icon cancel class,

94
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,840
and we need to set the
background position to use the

95
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,650
correct positioning
from our sprite.

96
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,150
Now Compass gives us the

97
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,440
sprite-position function helper.

98
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,810
We have to pass in the
sprite-map of the icons

99
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,180
variable and the name of our
icon, which in this case is

100
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,170
cancel, then it automatically
outputs that background

101
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,420
position for us.

102
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,520
Like we talked about in the
automatic method, though, this

103
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,360
is still missing some sort
of height and width.

104
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,650
We could use the Image Width and
Image Height helpers that

105
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,350
we saw back in Level Three.

106
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,400
But there's a sprite dimensions
mixin that's

107
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,140
included in Compass for us that
we just need to pass the

108
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,620
sprite-map again and the name of
the sprite, and it outputs

109
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,315
the height and the width
for us automatically.

110
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,400
Now if we want to use the cancel
icon in our sprite, we

111
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,100
simply need to use the i
element, give it that class,

112
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,970
and it just uses the portion of
the sprite at the correct

113
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,640
height and width for
that icon to show.

114
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,640
With that pattern set, now all
we need to do is build out the

115
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,390
other two icons.

116
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:54,770
So we create a class of icon
next and a class of icon

117
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,180
warning and set the appropriate
background

118
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,270
positions and sprite
dimensions.

119
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,780
So this works and we could
use this, but we

120
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,700
see a pattern forming.

121
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,070
The same code is used in each
example, only the name of the

122
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,410
file changes.

123
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:13,990
So there's still some ways to
optimize this using Sass.

124
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,430
First up, we can create a list
that just contains the names

125
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,390
of our icon files--

126
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,950
cancel, next, and warning--

127
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,660
store it in the Icon
Names list.

128
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,910
And we can loop through those,
kind of like we did with

129
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,650
authors earlier in the course,
and output the same bit of

130
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,500
code since that name is just
used in three locations.

131
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,830
Ultimately, our CSS compiles
to the exact same thing.

132
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,670
This is better, and all we would
need to do to update our

133
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:45,200
sprites now is add a new file
to the Icons folder and that

134
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,220
name to our Icon Names list.

135
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,670
But we're still manually
updating the Icon Names list.

136
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,630
We can really optimize
that a bit more.

137
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:01,320
Fortunately, Compass gives us
a sprite names function.

138
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,070
So we can pass our sprite-map
of icons into sprite names,

139
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:10,710
and it returns the list of the
no extension file names for

140
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,960
each icon automatically, which
is exactly what we need.

141
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,750
So any time we add an image
to our Icons folder, it

142
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,210
automatically is part of the
output of this and creates a

143
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,940
new class for us.

144
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,680
So the output is ultimately the
same, and we can see our

145
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,680
full bit of code here.

146
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,600
The only thing we need to do
to update our sprites is to

147
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,530
add a new icon to our
Icons folder.

148
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,540
There are other configuration
options in dealing with

149
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,550
sprites in Compass, like adding
white space around

150
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,860
every icon on a generated sprite
or having the generated

151
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,380
sprite be a different
orientation than vertical.

152
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,420
That's it for the video, so
you're on to the last set of

153
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,200
challenges.

154
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,950
Good luck, and we'll see you
again in the wrap-up.
