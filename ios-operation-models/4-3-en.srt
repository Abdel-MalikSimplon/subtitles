1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,840
Our UITextField is working
pretty well now,

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,510
but we have a problem.

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,980
It's in CityViewController
right now, but we really

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,580
should modify it to where it's
in a separate view controller.

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,400
We'll call that
EditNoteViewController.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,200
And this is the structure that
we want to end up with.

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,500
We want to have
CityViewController that has a

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,620
view holding a UI label that
will hold the notes data.

9
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,580
And we want a way
to transition to

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,570
EditNoteViewController, which
has its own view, that has

11
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,800
nothing but the UI text field
notesField inside of it.

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,560
The simplest way to do this
is to create a UIButton in

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,420
CityViewController and have the
action of that UIButton

14
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,540
call a method called
editPressed.

15
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,090
And inside of the editPressed
method, we will create a new

16
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,920
EditNoteViewController, set
the City property of the

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,270
EditNoteViewController to the
City object that's currently

18
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,510
in CityViewController, and
do a standard navigation

19
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,320
controller push where we push

20
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,200
EditNoteViewController onto the stack.

21
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:05,420
In EditNoteViewController, we're
going to need to import

22
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,700
City.h so that we can access
the City model.

23
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,750
We're also going to need to
create a City property.

24
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,870
And finally, we're thinking
ahead a little bit, and we're

25
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,990
going to need a UIButton
that takes us out of

26
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,260
EditNoteViewController and back
into CityViewController.

27
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,210
So it's probably a good idea
to declare a savePressed

28
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,575
method now also.

29
00:01:23,575 --> 00:01:26,070
You know the drill by now.

30
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,390
That's right, we've done this
a couple times now.

31
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,410
Inside of
EditNoteViewController's

32
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,700
viewDidLoad method, we're going
to want to instantiate a

33
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,530
copy of a City object.

34
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,610
Then we're going to want to
instantiate a notesField and

35
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,900
set the frame of the notesField
appear on the

36
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,070
screen and set the Delegate
property of that notesField so

37
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,940
that it can use those UITextField
delegate methods.

38
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,230
And then in viewWillAppear,
we're going to want to set the

39
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,070
text property of the notesField
equal to whatever

40
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,140
is currently in self.city.notes.

41
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,370
And that's so Higgie can
have a copy of what's already

42
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:00,310
in the Notes property available
in the UITextField

43
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,640
before he begins editing.

44
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,330
In the CityViewController, we
had an Edit button to take us

45
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,680
from CityView to EditNoteView.

46
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,220
And in EditNoteViewController,
we're going to need to Save

47
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,460
button to take us from
EditNoteView back into

48
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,060
CityView with our newly
saved data.

49
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,810
So we create a button, and we
set the action to a method

50
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,020
called savePressed.

51
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,460
In savePressed, we'll
do two things.

52
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,630
First, we'll set the
self.city.notes property equal

53
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,360
to whatever text is currently
in the notesField.

54
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,480
And then we'll call the
popViewControllerAnimated

55
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,930
method to pop us off the stack
back into CityViewController.

56
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,270
Let's see what that looks like
in action, and then you're off

57
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,520
to more challenges.
