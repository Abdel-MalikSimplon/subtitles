[SINGING]

2
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,460
He's got your data in his pocket
and a gun in his hand.

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,950
He's got his finger on the
trigger and a secret plan.

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,340
He'll take mutable arrays and
put them in formation using

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,700
your View Controllers
for his--

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,756
World domination.

[SINGING]

8
00:00:12,944 --> 00:00:16,690
He'll take your data into
models before it explodes, the

9
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,880
only secret agent who
encodes and decodes.

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,310
He's Mr. Higgie.

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
You're watching level six of
iOS Operation: Models.

12
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,940
And in this level, we're going
to add some features to Planet

13
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,690
Hig to make it more useful and
have a better user experience.

14
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,850
One of the first features we're
going to add is the

15
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,960
ability to view a list of
interesting places, and Higgie

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,420
is going to be able to mark
places as interesting and then

17
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,640
view them on a single
list later on.

18
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,940
To accomplish this, the
structure of Planet Hig is

19
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,660
going to be modified
a little bit.

20
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,765
We've still got our
InterestingPlaces

21
00:00:54,765 --> 00:00:57,730
TableViewController, but we're
going to need to create

22
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,240
a connection between
PlaceViewController and

23
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,800
InterestingPlacesViewController.

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,120
Looking at the structure of
Planet Hig, you see that we've

25
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,350
got almost everything
implemented except for

26
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,790
InterestingPlaces
TableViewController, so let's

27
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,720
look at how we're going to
implement that and where that

28
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,810
data is going to come from.

29
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,340
In the City Model, we're going
to add an NSArray called

30
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,250
interestingPlaces, and that
interestingPlaces array is

31
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,190
simply going to store a list
of Place model objects that

32
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,500
have been marked as interesting
by Higgie.

33
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,970
Just like we did when we added
a Notes property to the City

34
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,770
model, we're going to want to
set a default value for that

35
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,940
interestingPlaces array in
initWithJSON method.

36
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,550
In this case, we're going to
set it to nil because by

37
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,750
default, there are no places
that have been marked as

38
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,920
interesting.

39
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,610
So the place where Higgie is
going to mark a place as

40
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,150
interesting is in
PlaceViewController.

41
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,870
So in PlaceViewController, we'll
import City.h and create

42
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,890
a City property, and we're also
going to define a method

43
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,810
called makeThisPlaceInteresting,

44
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,670
which is going to be triggered
whenever Higgie taps a UI

45
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,920
button in the interface.

46
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,240
In the viewWillAppear method in
PlaceViewController, we're

47
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,150
creating our standard
UI button and

48
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,060
adding it as a sub view.

49
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,840
And the target action for that
button is a selector called

50
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,890
makeThisPlaceInteresting.

51
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,770
So whenever the user
taps on the button,

52
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,490
makeThisPlaceInteresting
will be called.

53
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,180
And we're going to do a couple
of things inside of

54
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,830
makeThisPlaceInteresting.

55
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,520
First we're going to get a
current copy of the city model

56
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,890
from the archive.

57
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,970
Next, we're going to create an
NSMutableArray temporary

58
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:37,300
array and initialize it
with the contents of

59
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,060
self.city.interestingPlaces.

60
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,170
This is going to give us a
temporary mutable array that

61
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,260
we can add an object to when
Higgie marks it as

62
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,940
interesting.

63
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,720
Next, we add the current
place object into

64
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,730
the temporary array.

65
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,060
Then we set
self.city.interestingPlaces,

66
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,780
which is the NS array inside the
model, equal to this new

67
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,290
temporary array that has an
additional item added.

68
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,875
And finally, since we modified
the state of the City Model,

69
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:11,830
we'll want to archive
it to disk.

70
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,590
So if we look at what that code
looks like, we now have a

71
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,990
UI button in the middle of
PlaceViewController, and we

72
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,160
tap on that UI button,
internally the City Model

73
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,860
nterestingPlaces property is
being updated to contain that

74
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,190
current place.

75
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,580
So next, we'll want to update
the interestingPlaces

76
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,550
TableViewController to show a
list of all of the content of

77
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,200
that interestingPlaces array.

78
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,730
We've got our standard UI
TableViewController methods

79
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,940
that we need to work with here,
which are TableView

80
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,495
numberOfRowsInSection,
TableView cellForRow

81
00:03:43,495 --> 00:03:46,180
AtIndexPath, and TableView
didSelectRowAtIndexPath.

82
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,855
In numberOfRowsInSection, we
can return self.city.

83
00:03:51,855 --> 00:03:56,440
interestingPlaces.count to make sure
that we have the right number

84
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,290
of rows that appear
in the table.

85
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,010
In cellForRowAtIndexPath, we
create a new cell and then we

86
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:07,700
set the cell's textLabel.text
property equal to the Name

87
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,350
property of the place model at
that position in the array.

88
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,660
And then in TableView
didSelectRowAtIndexPath, we're

89
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,820
going to go ahead and create a
new PlaceViewController, set

90
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,589
the Place property of the
PlaceViewController equal to

91
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:24,520
the Place model at this position
in the array, and

92
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,830
then push out to the
PlaceViewController.

93
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,380
Now if we start at the
PlaceViewController, mark a

94
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,630
place as interesting, and
then switch over to the

95
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,400
InterestingPlaces
TableViewController tab, we

96
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,590
can see that that place
appears in the list.

97
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,020
Now it's time for you to set up
some similar functionality

98
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,380
in InstaPhoto in
the challenges.
