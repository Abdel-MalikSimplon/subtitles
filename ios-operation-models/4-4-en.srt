00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,920
Our EditNoteViewController's
working great, but we can

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,170
improve on it even more.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,555
Only use a navigation controller
stack if you need

4
00:00:09,555 --> 00:00:12,160
to move through a hierarchy
of views.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,910
As usual, Mr. Higgie's right.

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,880
Navigation controllers are
great for expressing

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,090
hierarchies of different views
linked together, but whenever

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,690
we want to display one view
controller and go back

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,090
immediately to the original view
controller where we came

10
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,830
from, there's a better way.

11
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,410
And that way is called a
modal view controller.

12
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,750
So to use a modal view
controller instead of our

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,520
navigation controller stack,
all we need to do is change

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,090
the line where we were
pushing a new view

15
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,660
controller onto the stack.

16
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,580
And instead, we need to call
self presentViewController

17
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,810
animated completion, and pass
in an instance of our edit

18
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,550
note view controller.

19
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,670
And finally, in savePressed,
instead of using

20
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,090
popviewcontroller animated to
pop a view off the navigation

21
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,920
stack, we call the
dismissViewControllerAnimated

22
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,640
completion method and pass that
to the self object to

23
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,890
make the modal view go away.

24
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,430
Finally, it's another convention
to use UI bar

25
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,220
button items instead of standard
UI buttons whenever

26
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,330
you're presenting a modal
view controller.

27
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,870
We'll refactor our UI button
code into a UI bar button

28
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,790
item, and we'll pass
the message

29
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,540
initwithBarButtonSystemItem,
target, action.

30
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,450
Target and action work the same
here as they do in UI

31
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,330
button, but the
initwithBarButtonSystemItem

32
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:26,120
takes a constant that is equal
to whichever button item you

33
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,540
want to display.

34
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,000
We're using
UIBarButtonSystemItemEdit

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,330
here, but there's a list of 20
or 30 different options that

36
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,510
you have that you can check the
Apple documentation for.

37
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,890
Now that we have a UI bar but
item, we can put it in the top

38
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,370
right of our navigation bar by
setting self.navigation

39
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:49,120
Item.rightBarButtonItem equal
to our Editbutton object.

40
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,760
So here's Planet Hig working
with all these

41
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,350
enhancements we just made.

42
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,710
When we tap the Edit button in
the navigation bar, you can

43
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,120
see the EditNoteViewController
pop up, edit the text inside,

44
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,780
and then when we tap the Save
Note button, we get sent back

45
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,520
to the CityViewController and
the notes field is updated.

46
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,820
The structure of our application
has changed as

47
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,350
well, and you can see that
EditNoteViewController is now

48
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,915
represented as a path off
of CityViewController.

49
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,170
And now it's your turn to
complete some challenges.
