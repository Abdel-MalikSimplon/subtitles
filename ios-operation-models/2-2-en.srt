1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,490
Here's the user model that
you just created in the

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,400
Challenges.

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,990
We can make this model
even more efficient.

4
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,300
Notice that we're storing
NSStrings for profilePhoto and

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,610
profilePhotoThumbnail.

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,550
We really should be
storing these as a

7
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,740
single photo object.

8
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,450
So in user.h, I'm importing
the photo.h class so I can

9
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,640
access the photo model.

10
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,460
And I'm refactoring the
profilePhoto and

11
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,000
profilePhotoThumbnail to instead
just be one photo

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,285
object called ProfilePhoto.

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,590
Now in the Challenges, you're
going to need to refactor

14
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,100
initWithJSON to use a single photo
object instead of those

15
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,590
two profilePhoto and

16
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,300
profilePhotoThumbnail
NSStrings.
