1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
[SINGING] You started with
a string you need validated.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,660
Used conditionals, and
things got complicated.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:06,540
There's a better way.

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,998
We'll teach you the lessons,
and you'll be writing patterns

5
00:00:08,998 --> 00:00:10,200
with regular expressions.

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,300
Operators add a zing. 

7
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,175
Modifiers are the thing

8
00:00:12,175 --> 00:00:14,880
to find yourself the matches
on your subject string.

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,435
You'll be parsing files
if you follow our advice.

10
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:23,030
Sooner than you know it, you'll
be breaking the ice, ice ice.

11
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,340
Welcome back to Breaking the
Ice With Regular Expressions.

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,660
I hope you enjoyed
validating crew emails

13
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,340
and writing some more
complex patterns.

14
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,860
Let's now continue on
our Confirmative level.

15
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,520
We now have valid names
and email addresses

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,480
for our potential crew members.

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,340
The crew members
have also confirmed

18
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,160
that they're willing to
travel on our adventure.

19
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,740
However, each has answered
us in a different way.

20
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,450
And even more, each
potential crew member

21
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,980
has given us an answer
within a phrase.

22
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,580
So we're going to need to
extract each answer out

23
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,420
of these phrases
so we can decide

24
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,880
whether they're willing to go.

25
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,730
Our first acceptable
match is "OK".

26
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:08,070
So we can start our pattern
by using a literal OK, which

27
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,210
will match the characters "OK".

28
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,860
Now this gets us
on our first match.

29
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,480
However, it also appears we've
matched the "OK" within "okie

30
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,550
dokie".

31
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,450
Now if you remember, one of our
pattern goals is that we cannot

32
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,030
have a word that is
part of a larger word.

33
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,840
So we're going to need
to take care of this.

34
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,320
The word boundary
metacharacter, or backslash

35
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,056
"b", is an anchor like the
caret and the dollar sign,

36
00:01:32,056 --> 00:01:33,430
except it allows
you to perform

37
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,630
matches on whole words only.

38
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,400
So if you look at
our example, we

39
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,120
put a backslash "b" before
and after our backslash "w"

40
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,310
with the plus.

41
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,380
This results in boundaries
around each word

42
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,350
in our subject, around "learn",
around "by", and around "doing".

43
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:56,290
Using backslash "b", we can match
based upon the surrounding

44
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,030
words or characters,
and now we match

45
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:03,662
the letters "OK" in our subject,
but no longer match "okie dokie".

46
00:02:03,662 --> 00:02:04,870
So we're looking pretty good.

47
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,870
Next we need to match in
a different version of "OK",

48
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,010
spelled "O-k-a-y" with
a capital "O". Well,

49
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,250
how can we match different
versions of this word?

50
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:23,750
One thing we could do
would be to surround

51
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,680
our "OK" with boundary
metacharacters followed by an

52
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,230
or and then the other
version of "OK" that's

53
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,590
surrounded by boundary
metacharacters,

54
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,050
but this isn't very efficient.

55
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,710
If we had a way to
make the "a-y" optional,

56
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,220
we could match with
a single pattern.

57
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,270
So let's find a way
that we can do this.

58
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,430
We know that we can use
a literal to match "ship",

59
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,330
but if we try to match it
against something like "shirt",

60
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,890
we're not going to get a match.

61
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,980
The question mark operator
matches the proceeding pattern

62
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,140
zero to one time.

63
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,960
If we add one after
the "p" in "ship",

64
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,670
we're going to make
the "p" optional.

65
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,250
So we'll match on
"ship", but we'll also

66
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,890
get a partial match on "shirt".

67
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,070
We can also use the question
mark operator with a group.

68
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,250
So in this example,
we have "pirate ship".

69
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,120
By putting "ship" in a group
and putting a question mark

70
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,950
after it, we will make
the "ship" optional.

71
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,310
This allows us to match on both
"pirate ship" and "pirate boat".

72
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:36,150
So if we have a group
with "a-y", after the "OK",

73
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,120
with a question mark,
we'll make the "a-y" portion

74
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,920
of the pattern optional.

75
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,354
This will allow us to
match on "OK" or "O-k-a-y".

76
00:03:45,354 --> 00:03:46,770
Just like we've
done before, we're

77
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,690
going to add the "i"
modifier to handle

78
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:52,260
for uppercase and lowercase
characters within our pattern.

79
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,920
Now both variations
of "OK" are accepted.

80
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,230
Another potential key word a
shipmate may enter is "sure".

81
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,810
However, we're not checking
for this right now.

82
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,620
Using the OR
operator, we can match

83
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,850
either version of "OK" or "sure".

84
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,280
And because we're
using the backslash "b",

85
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,480
we're automatically just
going to be matching on words.

86
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,190
However, we're also getting
a partial match here.

87
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,140
This is because
the first boundary

88
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,200
is right before the "OK"
portion in our pattern,

89
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,600
and the second boundary
is right after the "sure".

90
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,250
How can we make
the boundary anchor

91
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,920
to both the beginning and the
end of "OK" and the beginning

92
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,480
and the end of "sure"?

93
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,490
Using a group, we
can encapsulate

94
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,100
the "OK" and "sure"
portion of our pattern,

95
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,670
giving us our
intended result. This

96
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:47,680
means that our desired matches
only appear as single words

97
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,450
and our subject "ensure"
no longer matches.

98
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,860
Much like matching "sure", we
can use another OR operator

99
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,790
and add "yes" to match on
our next acceptable answer.

100
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:05,600
However, this won't match on
the single character "y", which

101
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,750
is also an acceptable answer.

102
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,370
So let's go ahead
and handle for this.

103
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,590
Well, much like our
two versions of "OK",

104
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:20,290
we can construct two versions
of "yes"-- the "y" and the "y-e-s".

105
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,150
By surrounding the "e-s"
in a group and adding

106
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,310
another one of those
question mark operators,

107
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,530
we'll make the "e-s" optional.

108
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,345
And this allows us to
match on "y" and "y-e-s".

109
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,019
Our pattern is now
matching all answers

110
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:38,060
from potential shipmates.

111
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,480
It's now your turn to
try writing some patterns

112
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,030
with boundaries and optionals.
