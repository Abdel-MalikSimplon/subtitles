1
00:00:01,892 --> 00:00:02,128
[SINGING]

2
00:00:02,128 --> 00:00:05,780
Wanted and captured without
bail, locked and forgotten in

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:06,175
a rusty jail.

4
00:00:06,175 --> 00:00:08,430
Zombies attacked, the
townsfolk fled.

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,390
Those who were left
became the undead.

6
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,350
He's the zombie outlaw.

7
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,310
He's the zombie outlaw.

8
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:18,230
And he's fighting the law
that left him for dead,

9
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,660
for dead, for dead.

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,010
My name is Carlo Souza, and
you're watching Rails 4,

11
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,689
Zombie Outlaws. In this level,
we're going to be

12
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:35,330
looking at views.

13
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:38,580
Say we have an Owner class
which has many items.

14
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,440
And each item obviously
belongs to an owner.

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,180
In Rails 3 and 4, if you wanted
to build a Select box

16
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,350
for owners, you could do it
with a single method call,

17
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,920
just by passing the collection
of owners.

18
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,620
We can do this using the
Collection Select method, as

19
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,220
you can see it over here.

20
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,640
But what if we need radio
buttons or check boxes?

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,120
Well in Rails 3, if you wanted
to do this, we needed a loop

22
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,710
and build each of the individual
HTML elements.

23
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,920
Now in Rails 4, we have the
collection_radio_button

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,270
methods that behave just like
the collection_select and

25
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,980
takes the same arguments.

26
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,920
Also, if you have the
many-to-many relationship, you

27
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,300
could use the collection_check_boxes
method to dynamically

28
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,120
build check boxes
for your models.

29
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,300
At some point, you might used
the date_select form helper

30
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,800
that generates a set of select
boxes that looks

31
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,210
something like this.

32
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,770
The HTML behind them, it's
kind of verbose.

33
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,360
And he uses three individual
arguments to

34
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,550
represent the date--

35
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:42,915
one for the year, one for the
month, and one for the day.

36
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,860
Rails 4 now, gives us the Date
Field form helper, which

37
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,190
generates a much better
looking HTML element.

38
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,200
Notice that uses the type
"date." And since it uses a

39
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,950
single HTML element to represent
the date, it also

40
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,780
returns a single parameter
to our application.

41
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:07,310
If you're using a browser that
supports this HTML5 type date,

42
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,009
then you're going to see
a calendar that looks

43
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:10,820
something like this.

44
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,610
Otherwise, if your browser
doesn't support this type,

45
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,960
then you're going to fall back
to a text field that looks

46
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,160
something like this.

47
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,250
So for now, it's best to stick
with a third-party library,

48
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,550
like jQuery-ui Date Picker,
for example.

49
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,740
Now let's take a look at this
Index action from our

50
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,360
controller that uses the Respond
To block to return an

51
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,480
HTML or JSON response based
on the request.

52
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,780
If a request comes in asking
for JSON, this is what a

53
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,440
response would look like.

54
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,640
But what if you need to
customize this JSON response?

55
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,750
Well, one way to do
it is to use the

56
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,600
Jbuilder template handler.

57
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,360
This way, we can use the
Jbuilder API to build our

58
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,810
custom JSON structure that gets

59
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,540
returned from the request.

60
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,470
In this case, here's what the
output would look like.

61
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,970
Rails 4 now gives us another
template handler that allows

62
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,510
us to write pure Ruby.

63
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,760
In this case, we're using Ruby
to build what our response

64
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,480
could look like.

65
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,370
And we're explicitly calling
to JSON on our collection.

66
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,380
In order to use the Ruby
template handler, all you have

67
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,420
to do is to add the .ruby
extension to your view file.

68
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,530
And here's how the output
would look like.
