16
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,940
So now, you're a master
of the loop, right?

17
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,600
Hope you enjoyed Level 1,
and now on to Level 2.

18
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,520
Sometimes when we're developing,
our code needs to

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,890
decide whether to take one
track or the other.

20
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,945
And, so we have arrived at Level
2: Conditional Canyon.

21
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,470
You'll remember in the previous
level that we printed

22
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:57,100
out all operational trains, as
well as all non-operational

23
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,520
trains in our new
train system.

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,990
We used two loops to do that,
and here is our previous code.

25
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,540
You can see that we used both a
While loop and a for-loop to

26
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,670
get through all of the trains.

27
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,740
Our goal here is now to
get all of that code

28
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,700
inside one for-loop.

29
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,950
How would we design that?

30
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,940
Well, here we have a for-loop
that loops through not just

31
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,560
the operational trains, but
through all of the trains.

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,710
We have it checking to see
whether the train number is

33
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,380
less than or equal to the
total amount of trains.

34
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,510
That means that this for-loop
will move over every single

35
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,620
possible train number.

36
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,090
But now we need to know how to
differentiate between whether

37
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,270
the train is running or whether
it's not running.

38
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:44,060
So if the train is currently
running, we want to print this

39
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,540
particular statement, and if
it's not, we want to print

40
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,560
this other statement that
shows that it's not

41
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,750
operational.

42
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,000
How can we do that?

43
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,670
Again, the goal here is to
figure out how we can run

44
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,780
different lines of code based
on different conditions.

45
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,630
Guess what?

46
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,480
We have a JavaScript trick for
that, and it's called If, and

47
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,480
her buddy, Else.

48
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,490
The If and Else statements allow
us to execute certain

49
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:13,890
code, but based on specific
conditions.

50
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,630
Here is the basic shell of an
If and an Else statement.

51
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,060
If some condition is
true, then we're

52
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,290
going to do this code.

53
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,750
This code is the code
inside the If block.

54
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,570
Else says otherwise do
this code instead.

55
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,465
Notice that if the condition in
the If block is true, only

56
00:02:35,465 --> 00:02:37,660
the If code gets executed.

57
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,940
And the Else code only gets
executed if the If

58
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,225
condition is false.

59
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,270
Here's a basic example of
conditional execution.

60
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,350
Say we had two values, value 1
and value 2, and we've set

61
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,660
them to 4 and 9.

62
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,480
Let's use some conditional
statements to compare and

63
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,590
print out whether one is
greater than the other.

64
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:04,220
Here, we can see that if we do a
comparison of if the value 1

65
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,460
is less than the value 2, we
print out that that is true.

66
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,120
Value 1 is less than value 2.

67
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,410
Else, or otherwise, meaning if
value 1 is not less than value

68
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,950
2, we would print out that value
1 must be greater than

69
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,240
or equal to value 2.

70
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,090
That's because we don't strictly
know whether value 1

71
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,380
is greater than because
it might be equal to.

72
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:34,500
So in this case, because value
1 is 4 and value 2 is 9, the

73
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,450
If block would trigger
because it's

74
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,890
conditional would be true.

75
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,600
Value 1 is less than value 9,
and so we would get the

76
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,700
printout that 4 is
less than 9.

77
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,180
What happens if we change
value 1 to 12?

78
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,670
Obviously, we have a different
relationship now.

79
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,380
So now the If block
will not trigger.

80
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:54,700
Why?

81
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,220
Because 12 is not less than 9.

82
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,040
And so we will move into the
Else block, and we will get a

83
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,430
printout that says 12 is greater
than or equal to 9.

84
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,680
Just trust us.

85
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,860
Now that we've got some
experience with an If and an

86
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,480
Else block, let's go see
if we can make a

87
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,810
difference in our problem.

88
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,110
Our original problem was that
we needed to figure out

89
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,649
whether a train was running
or whether it

90
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:21,860
wasn't inside one loop.

91
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,650
And now you can probably see how
we would use and If and an

92
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,950
Else to make that situation
work out.

93
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,900
So, we know that if the train
number is less than or equal

94
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,000
to the operational trains, that
means that it's a running

95
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,050
train because we know that all
operational trains are

96
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,320
numbered from one moving
forward.

97
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,540
Therefore, we can print out
that that particular train

98
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,570
number is operating.

99
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:51,160
Next, we know that if train
number was not less than or

100
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,400
equal to the operational trains,
it must be greater

101
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,090
than the operational trains
and, therefore,

102
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,970
a non-running train.

103
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,360
So we would print out that
it was not operational.

104
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,760
So now, let's run our new single
loop with our special

105
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,170
conditionals.

106
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,600
We can see that when train
number is 1, the first thing

107
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,000
that happens inside
the loop is it

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,540
checks the loop condition.

109
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,640
Is 1 less than or equal to 12?

110
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,300
Yes, it is.

111
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,140
That's true.

112
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,260
So we will move forward
with the loop.

113
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,230
The loop will actually
continue.

114
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:27,050
And then it will check the
condition, is the train number

115
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,340
1 less than or equal to 8?

116
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,020
Yes, it is.

117
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,010
And so we will move into the
If block and print out that

118
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,960
train number 1 is running.

119
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,320
That same procedure will happen
all the way through

120
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,030
train number 8, where we'll get
printouts that each one of

121
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,640
those trains is running.

122
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,810
When we finally get the train
number 9, what will happen is

123
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,830
the loop condition
will check out.

124
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,210
It will be cool, and we
will continue to loop.

125
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:56,090
But our train number 9 is not
less than or equal to 8, and

126
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:00,170
so we will move to the Else
block instead of the If block.

127
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:04,040
And now we will see that train
number 9 is not operational.

128
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,580
That same procedure will occur
through the remaining trains

129
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,530
all the way to train
number 12.

130
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,940
That will be our last
non-operational train.

131
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:17,320
But when the train number becomes 13, finally the loop

132
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,530
condition itself will be false, and the

133
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,770
entire loop will stop.

134
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,480
So now, we have printed out every
last train and whether

135
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,240
it is running or whether
it is not.

136
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,120
And we have done it all in
one magical loop using

137
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,370
conditionals.
