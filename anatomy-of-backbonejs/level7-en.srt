Your client-side JavaScript
is starting to mold.

00:00:02,895 --> 00:00:06,550
It's starting to resemble
a bad spaghetti code.

00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,090
And it is time to add
structure, but it

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,160
won't take too long.

You're watching the Anatomy

This is Level 7:

Routers and History.

16
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,330
So we have a little problem
in our app right now.

17
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,670
As you can see, over to the
right of each item, we have a

18
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:47,560
little link.

19
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,050
And we want that link to take us
to a page that'll show just

20
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,400
that one item.

21
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,660
But we don't want to refresh
the whole page.

22
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,860
We actually just want to use a
little bit of JavaScript, as

23
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,850
you can see here--

24
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:06,690
using something like jQuery to
just show that one item.

25
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,720
Let's see what happens when we
implement this link using

26
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,370
plain jQuery.

27
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:15,180
When I click on the link, I am
shown just that one item.

28
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,580
But now let's say I want to hit
the Back button to go back

29
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,800
to the full list. Well when I
do that, I'm actually taken

30
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,560
out of the entire app
back to Google.

31
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,160
This is not what we want.

32
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,990
And, actually, Backbone has this
problem solved with the

33
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,370
router and history.

34
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,010
First, let's introduce
Backbone's router.

35
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:37,600
Now the router's job is to
map URLs to actions.

36
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,470
As you can see here, we're
creating a new router.

37
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,870
And we're going to pass
in a routes object.

38
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:49,320
This is going to map a URL
to a single action.

39
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,060
In this case, when the URL
todos, the action will be

40
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,630
index. And that index:
function is

41
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,800
defined on the router.

42
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:05,330
So when the URL in your browser
is say, /todos or

43
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,590
#todos, the index action
will be called.

44
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,430
If you're unfamiliar with that
hash mark syntax, we're going

45
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,570
to cover it a little
bit later.

46
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:17,090
Let's dive a little bit more
into that routes object.

47
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,340
As you can see here, we're
defining a new route,

48
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,350
and that's going to match
todos/:id and call the

49
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,540
show action.

50
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,600
But this id is actually
a parameter.

51
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,850
It can be anything.

52
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,890
For example, it could be
/todos/1, /todos/2,

53
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,180
/todos/hello.

54
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,560
And that parameter that is
matched will actually get

55
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,970
passed to the show action.

56
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,000
Let's look at a couple more
route matchers that you can

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,780
use in your routers.

58
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,840
Our first one here is going
to match search/:query.

59
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,760
For example, search/ruby.

60
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,100
And that'll pass that one
parameter into the action.

61
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,120
The second one will actually
match two parameters--

62
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,430
the first one being query
and the second one being

63
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,260
page, And both of those will
get passed to the action.

64
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,590
Same kind of thing with the
third example here where both

65
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,370
name and mode will get
passed to the action.

66
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,550
And then there's a wild card
matcher which will match

67
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,820
everything after a
certain point.

68
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:24,070
So in this example,
hello/world.txt will get set

69
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,570
as the only parameter
to the action.

70
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,740
Now you may be wondering how
do we trigger these routes.

71
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,160
Well we can use the router's
navigate function.

72
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,630
With that all we have to
do is pass in the URL

73
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,250
as the first argument.

74
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,730
And if we actually want to
trigger the action, we pass in

75
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:44,640
trigger: true.

76
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,240
If we didn't pass in trigger:
true here, the browser URL

77
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,450
would update, but our action
would not be called.

78
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,310
And, of course, we can just
use normal links.

79
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,870
Unfortunately, these aren't
actually going to work yet.

80
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:02,330
And before we show you how to
fix it, let's go back and see

81
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:06,210
how people have solved this
history problem before.

82
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:10,020
You may be familiar with using
the Gmail web client.

83
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,470
And they solve history by using
that hash mark thing

84
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,070
that I was showing
you earlier.

85
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,955
As you can see here, when I
click on the Starred, we're

86
00:04:17,955 --> 00:04:20,010
not actually doing a
whole page refresh.

87
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,310
But we are changing the
URL to #starred.

88
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,210
And this way when you click
Back, it's not actually going

89
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,400
to take you back all the way.

90
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,980
It's just going to take you back
to where you were before

91
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,810
you clicked Starred.

92
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,700
Now Basecamp Next does this a
little differently but in a

93
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,930
similar way.

94
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,260
Instead of using that hash mark
that Gmail used, they

95
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,320
actually use a new HTML5
API called pushState.

96
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,140
And this lets them update
the browser URL.

97
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,300
And instead of using
a hash mark, it

98
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,740
uses the regular slash.

99
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,030
So it looks like a real URL.

100
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,570
Backbone will actually let you
do both of these approaches to

101
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,610
saving history in the browser.

102
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,810
But I would suggest
using pushState.

103
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,150
Now browser support isn't
great right now.

104
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,770
But it's really close.

105
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,390
And there's a lot of advantages
to using pushState

106
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,640
as I'll go over later.

107
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,910
Let's go back to our
Backbone code.

108
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,400
As we saw earlier, our navigate
and our links weren't

109
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,170
working yet.

110
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:23,190
Now to make these work, we first
have to use the backbone

111
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,770
history API.

112
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,080
All we have to do is call
Backbone.history.start():

113
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,000
And as you can see here, if
we call start with no

114
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,950
parameters pushState
is going to be off.

115
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,110
And our URLs are going
to have that hash

116
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,870
mark in front of them.

117
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,420
And this is not great.

118
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,020
Instead when you call
start you can pass

119
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,830
in {pushState: true}.

120
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:47,530
And now when we navigate on our
router, we'll have a slash

121
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:51,260
in front of our URL instead
of that hash mark.

122
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:55,700
Let's take these concepts and
implement our Todo app router.

123
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,250
Here we're creating a router
class much like we did with

124
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,150
models and collections
and views.

125
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,980
When we create that class, we
pass in a routes object.

126
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,910
And we're going to start out
by defining the show action

127
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,950
which'll match on todo/:id

128
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,200
Now let's define that
show action

129
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,690
accepting the id as a parameter.

130
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:22,730
And we're going to call this
focusOnTodoItem function on a

131
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,270
todoList collection.

132
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,850
This focusOnTodoItem function
has already been defined.

133
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:32,380
And all it will do is to reset
the collection to show only

134
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,150
the TodoItem that matches the
id that is passed in.

135
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,450
But you might be wondering
where we're getting that

136
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,510
todoList from.

137
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,960
Well I'm going to define
an initialize

138
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,890
function on our router.

139
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:48,390
This function takes an options
object and will assign the

140
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:52,080
TodoList to the router
from the options.

141
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,310
Now when we create our
TodoRouter instance.

142
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,310
We pass in an object with
TodoList collection.

143
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,680
What happens if after the user
goes to the show action,

144
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,970
they hit the Back button?

145
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,190
Well they're going to end up
back on the root route which

146
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,690
has no URL.

147
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:13,530
So we need to define the root
route on our router.

148
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:17,280
We do that by just using an
empty string as seen here.

149
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,970
And we want to call the index
action when the root

150
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,610
route is matched.

151
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,570
Now when we define our index
action all we're going to do

152
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,060
is call fetch on
the collection.

153
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,340
And this will get all the
todoItems from the server and

154
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,550
display that to the user.

155
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,910
Now let's see our router
in action.

156
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,920
As you can see here, we've got
a list of todoItems. And when

157
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,480
I click on that link, I'm shown
just that one todoItem.

158
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,200
And our URL in the browser
has been updated.

159
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,500
Now when I hit the Back button,
I'm going to go back

160
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,930
to the root route, and my list
is going to refresh.

161
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,560
And I can click on other links
and go back and forth.

162
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,650
And the history works
as we expect.

163
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,070
To finish it all up, we can use
our router as a good place

164
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,860
to organize some of the code
that we've been writing.

165
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,240
Instead of defining a whole new
router class, since we're

166
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,180
only really going to have one
router instance, let's just go

167
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,240
ahead and create the router
instance directly.

168
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,360
Now we have our routes that
matches are root route to the

169
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,380
index action and our
todos/:id to the show

170
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,730
action just like before.

171
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:29,930
When we initialize our router,
we will go ahead and create a

172
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,770
new TodoList collection.

173
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:35,409
Then we will create our TodoList
view and pass in that

174
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:36,380
collection.

175
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,120
The last thing we need to do in
initialize is append that

176
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,400
collection views element
to our DOM.

177
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,140
We're going to define a new
function called start.

178
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,020
And all that's going to do is
call back our history start

179
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,140
with pushState: true.

180
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,610
Next our index function which
we've seen before, and our

181
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,640
show function as well.

182
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,620
The really neat thing about
using our router to organize

183
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,990
our code this way is when our
page first loads, we can use

184
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,010
the jQuery ready function.

185
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,140
And all we have to do is
call TodoApp.start.

186
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,740
And that'll start our whole
app and everything will be

187
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,680
initialized.

188
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,930
And we'll be good to go.

189
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,450
Well that's it for Level 7:

190
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,840
Routers and History.

191
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,420
I hope you enjoyed the course.

192
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,420
Now you have some
more work to do.

193
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,620
But I'm out of here.
