00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840

00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,250
(SINGING) Your online
application's starting to

3
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,910
fail, it's crawling on
the network just

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,490
as fast as a snail.

5
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,660
We need evented programming,
starting from the top.

6
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,370
Better write some code, so
the world doesn't stop.

7
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:19,360
With the non-blocking model
we will be just fine.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,380
Built on Google Chrome's
v8 runtime.

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,980
And all you need to do is write
some JavaScript code and

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,120
use the Real Time
Web with Node.

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,246

12
00:00:32,246 --> 00:00:35,185
(SPEAKING) In the Real Time Web
with Node.JS, Eric Allam

13
00:00:35,185 --> 00:00:37,660
and Gregg Pollack will take you
through seven high quality

14
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,740
screen tasks and 45 in- browser
code challenges, so

15
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,620
you can learn how to use
JavaScript on the server side.

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,010
Let's take a look at the
interface for this course.

17
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,550
The first video lesson
will be your

18
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,980
introduction to level one.

19
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,940
You can skip around chapters
using the numbers at the top.

20
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,330
And when you're ready to start
the challenges, just hit the

21
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,010
big button below the video.

22
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,640
In the challenge interface,
you'll see your total points,

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,150
the number of points this
challenge is worth, and the

24
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,670
challenge instructions.

25
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,420
Just below, a JavaScript code
editor will allow you to type

26
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,130
in your answer to
the challenge.

27
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,340
If you don't get it right, an
error message will give you

28
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,150
some feedback.

29
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,970
You can look at the
video slides.

30
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,620
And there's no shame in asking
for a hint, so you don't get

31
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,850
stuck for too long.

32
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,940
On the left side of the screen,
you will see a list of

33
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,390
the challenges for this level.

34
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,410
You can re-watch the video if
you need to, learn how to use

35
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,300
the interface shortcuts, and
download the slides, in case

36
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,440
you need some reference
material for later.

37
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,940
In this course, we'll cover the
non-blocking concept and

38
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:30,930
the event loop.

39
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,590
We'll learn how to listen,
trigger and create events.

40
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,050
Then we'll look at streams at
the core of the Real Time

41
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:36,990
infrastructure.

42
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,280
Modules will allow us to share
and use third party code, like

43
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,570
the Express web framework and
Socket.io, so we can use the

44
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,910
websockets API.

45
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,440
Finally, we'll discover how to
use Redis to store our data.

46
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,720
For each level you complete,
you'll receive a badge,

47
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,030
finally earning the course
completion badge which will be

48
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,950
displayed in your
public profile.

49
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,590
Finishing this course will
unlock a final video and

50
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,560
resources to continue learning
Node.JS and server side

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,480
JavaScript.

52
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,220
You'll also receive a discount
on your subscription or your

53
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,930
next Code School course.

54
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,509
To be able to play Real Time web
with Node.JS, you'll need

55
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:11,270
to have some basic knowledge of
JavaScript and server side

56
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,070
programming.

57
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,400
If you don't, you should take a
look at our previous courses

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,690
on Jquery and Backbone.JS, the
first one of which is free.

59
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,757
