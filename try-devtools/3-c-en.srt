1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,260


2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,850
Another benefit our console
gives us is a handful of

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,760
helper methods that make it
easier to work with our

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,930
application.

5
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,350
Say we want to perform some
operations on the heading at

6
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,560
the top of the page, which
has an ID of Title.

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,770
We could laboriously
type out a call to

8
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:21,560
document.querySelector, but the
console provides us with a

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,030
shorthand way of doing this,
a function named with the

10
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,310
dollar-sign character sometimes
called bling.

11
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,880
Just typing bling with the Title
ID will save you a lot

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,820
of time and keystrokes.

13
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,370
You should be aware that many
JavaScript libraries come with

14
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,290
their own version of bling.

15
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,180
So if you load jQuery, for
example, it's going to

16
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,190
override the console's bling
with the jQuery bling.

17
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,430


18
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,440
In our sample app, we
are using jQuery.

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,360
So when we use the bling, even
if we send it an ID, it's

20
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,740
going to return us an array of
dom nodes instead of one.

21
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,030
So to get the same result, we
have to explicitly select the

22
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,350
first element of the array
using square brackets 0.

23
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,420
Now what if I want to use the
bling to grab an element from

24
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,990
the page and then figure out
where that is inside of my DOM

25
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,510
inside the Elements panel?

26
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,090
We can do that by grabbing an
element and passing it into

27
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,310
the inspect method.

28
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,590
That node is then selected
inside of our Elements panel.

29
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,930
We can also do the reverse.

30
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,080
Let's say you've selected a
node inside the Elements

31
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,630
panel, and you want to work
with it on the console.

32
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,770
Chrome keeps a history
of your selections.

33
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,700
The most recent one is stored
in the bling 0 variable.

34
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,690
So if we enter that, we get
the node we last selected.

35
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,080
If you'd like to view the dom
node you selected before this

36
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,730
one, you can actually
type bling 1.

37
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,740
Bling 2 will then go two
selections back in the

38
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,370
history and so on.

39
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:45,880
All right.

40
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,480
I hope you're ready to try out
some of this new bling in the

41
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,730
Challenges.
