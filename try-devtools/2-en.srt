1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,510


2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,960
All of the changes we've been
making to our web pages using

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,860
the Elements panel have been
temporary, meaning as soon as

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,550
we refresh our page, boom, all
of our changes are gone.

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,090
If we really want to make
modifications to our web page,

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,340
well, we have to make changes
to the source files.

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,380
This is where the Source
panel comes in.

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,120
You can edit your file right
there in the web page, it kind

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,400
of looks like an editor.

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,540
You can export that to disk when
you're done editing, and

11
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,290
you can also see a revision
history so you can see all the

12
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,840
changes that you've made
to the file over time.

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,670
As we saw at the end of the last
chapter, clicking a file

14
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,480
name in the style section of
Elements panel will open that

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,630
file in the Sources panel.

16
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,800
I think the text on our Add
Event button should be a

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,930
little bit bigger.

18
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,630
So let's go ahead and
edit it right here

19
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,300
in the Sources panel.

20
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,970
As you can see, while I'm
editing the CSS, the page

21
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,750
instantly reflects the changes
that I'm making.

22
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,902
You may notice that we now have
a star next to the file

23
00:00:54,902 --> 00:00:57,060
name here in our
Sources panel.

24
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,910
That means we need
to save the file.

25
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:03,580
So we can hit Control S, or
Command S if we're on a Mac,

26
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,489
and it will Save the file.

27
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,940
Now, it's just saving to
our browser's storage.

28
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:13,430
It's not saving to our original
source files.

29
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,110
To see all of the modifications
that we've made

30
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,990
here in the browser, we can
right click on a particular

31
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,690
file and select Local
Modifications.

32
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,510
This will show us a list of time
stamps and when we open

33
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,700
them up, we can see the
different changes that we've

34
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,910
made along the way.

35
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,170
So here we can see the font
sizes change from 1.6 EMs in

36
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,210
red to 3 EMs in green.

37
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,590
You also might notice that each
revision has an Apply

38
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,040
Revision Content button
next to it.

39
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,590
If we click that, the changes
from that revision will be

40
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,510
applied to the current revision
and a new revision

41
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,260
will be added with those
changes at the top.

42
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,760
Unfortunately, I'm not very
happy with the changes that

43
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,980
we've made here, but
fortunately,

44
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,320
there's a Revert button.

45
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,660
I can click that, it's going
to blow away all of my

46
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,920
modifications, and put
the file back in

47
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,670
its original state.

48
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,130
Sometimes you're going to make
a lot of changes here in Dev

49
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:03,000
tools and you're going to want
to save that back over the

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,990
original source file.

51
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,370
Luckily, we can do that.

52
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,100
To do this, you can simply right
click on the source file

53
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,660
you want to save and
click Save As.

54
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,170
In our case, we're going to go
into our project folder and

55
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,790
simply overwrite the original
source file.

56
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,360
There's no substitute for
practice so it's time for you

57
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,610
to jump into the challenges.
