00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,710
You're watching Discovering Dev
Tools and this is level

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,230
seven, where we're going to be
learning about memory leaks.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,210
You may have heard the term
memory leak before.

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,810
It usually happens when an
application takes up more and

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:17,170
more memory on your computer to
the point where it starts

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,630
to slow everything down and
maybe even crashes.

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,730
Well, you can even write
JavaScript code that can cause

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,810
memory leaks and without even
knowing about it, so that when

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,200
somebody's running your
application in a browser,

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,270
things might tend to slow down
as your application takes more

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,590
and more memory.

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,540
Well, let's take a look at the
memory section of the timeline

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:44,250
to see how we can identify and
diagnose some memory leaks.

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,400
I've added the ability for our
users to hide the add event

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,990
entry form by just hitting
the Escape key.

16
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,850
However, now we're getting
complaints from our customers

17
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,790
that after they use our page
for a long time, that it

18
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,160
starts to slow down.

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,090
This might be a memory leak.

20
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,340
Let's see if we can
diagnose it.

21
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,769
First, we'll go to the Timeline
panel and click on

22
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,710
the Memory section
on the right.

23
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,660
Just like in the previous
chapter, we need to hit the

24
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,850
Record button and then interact
with our application

25
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,130
a little bit.

26
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,310
I'll open and close the
form a few times,

27
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,560
then stop the recording.

28
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,120
The graph you see shows the
amount of memory allocated to

29
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,560
our application.

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,730
It looks like our application
is consuming more and more

31
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,450
memory the longer we use it,
which is a good sign for a

32
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,810
memory leak.

33
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,830
Healthy applications don't just

34
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,540
continuously grow in memory.

35
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,260
Why don't you give this a
try in the challenges?
