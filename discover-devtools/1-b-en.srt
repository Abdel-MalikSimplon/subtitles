1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,210
So we've learned about making
real time updates to the DOM,

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,890
but what if we want to
make changes to our

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,620
style sheets or CSS?

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,980
Well, that's where
the right side of

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,660
Elements panel comes in.

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,240
The styles view does
a lot for us.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,340
First off, it displays the
computed CSS styles for any

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,780
given element.

9
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,020
See, on any element, you might
have multiple styles coming

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,370
from multiple files, multiple
style sheets, and they get

11
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:30,080
computed into a listing
that you see here.

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,600
The styles view also allows
you to enable and disable

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,050
style properties, add new
ones, edit rules on

14
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,490
pseudo-classes, like your
active and hover state.

15
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,680
And finally, it provides a bread
crumb trail so you can

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,720
figure out what file
a style came from.

17
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,630
Here you can see, I have the Add
Event button selected on

18
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,440
the left side.

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,060
And on the right side, I can
see all the CSS rules being

20
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,390
applied to this button,
starting with the most

21
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,470
specific rules first.

22
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,490
So if I had any inline styles,
they would be displayed here.

23
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,430
And then, there's a label that's
showing us the first

24
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,490
set of CSS rules coming from the
new class since our link

25
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,340
belongs to that class.

26
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,620
You see all those check boxes
next to those styles?

27
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,890
Well, they do what you would
expect them to do.

28
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,990
If you unclick a style,
it stops getting

29
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,330
applied to that element.

30
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,060
This is really useful
in debugging.

31
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,050
If you're wondering what style
is messing up your page, you

32
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,610
can just start disabling the
styles until you figure out

33
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,940
who the culprit is.

34
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,900
We can also change the
style values by

35
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,180
double clicking on them.

36
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,000
So now, our button text is
aligned to the right, as you

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,790
can see above.

38
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,890
Or we can remove a property
entirely by just deleting the

39
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,870
value, and now our text
is over on the

40
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,110
left side of the button.

41
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,170
If you want to add a style to an
element, just make sure it's

42
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,080
selected and just hit the
Plus button here.

43
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,880
We then, will want to specify
the CSS selector, which, as

44
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,860
you can see, is defaulted to the
dot new class since that's

45
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,860
what we have selected.

46
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,050
We can then start typing a new
style, and look at that.

47
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,910
It actually allows us to auto
complete each of the

48
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,330
properties and values
using the Tab key.

49
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,140
Now, what if we wanted to change
our Add Event button so

50
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,760
that it changes to a different
color when our

51
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,720
mouse hovers over it?

52
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,900
It might be kind of hard to
hover the mouse over it while

53
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,910
we're trying to use Dev Tools.

54
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,970
But, there's a solution
for this.

55
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,640
If we click on this icon, on
the right side here, we can

56
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,510
force the element we have
selected, the button in this

57
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,650
case, to be in the
active, hover,

58
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,410
focused, or visited state.

59
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,200
In this case, we want
the hover state so

60
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,845
we'll check that off.

61
00:02:22,845 --> 00:02:25,270
And as you can see here, the
button text up above is

62
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,310
underlined.

63
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,380
We can also see the style for
the hover state, which makes

64
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,920
underlined right here in the
bottom right of the screen.

65
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,230
If you want to change the
background color on hover, we

66
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,270
can just add the style here,
and immediately see that it

67
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,760
turns black in the web page.

68
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,650
When we're ready to actually
watch it work, we can uncheck

69
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,300
the hover state and
play with it.

70
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,080
Yep, looks like it works.

71
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,910
Black is obviously not a great
color for this hover state, so

72
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,770
let's change it.

73
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,030
But this time, instead of typing
a value, let's click on

74
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,970
that color swatch right there.

75
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,570
When we see that, we can get
this nice color picker so we

76
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,660
can choose our color this
way, and come up

77
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,910
with a better match.

78
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,650
Lastly, our style view allows us
to know where a particular

79
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,830
style came from.

80
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,960
You might notice that in our CSS
panel, each CSS rule has a

81
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,310
file name listed on the right
side with a line number.

82
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,430
When you click on this file,
that opens up the CSS source

83
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,080
in something that resembles
an editor.

84
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,150
This is actually the source
view panel, which we'll be

85
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,480
going over in the
next chapter.

86
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,570
So let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

87
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,550
First, it's time for you to play
with the style view in

88
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,800
the challenges.
