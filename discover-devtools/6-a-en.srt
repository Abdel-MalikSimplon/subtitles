1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,700
You're watching Discover
DevTools, and this is level

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,290
six, where we're going to be
talking about frames and the

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,170
CPU profiler.

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,140
As we saw in the previous level,
you can speed up your

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,220
web page by optimizing your
network interactions.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,420
But sometimes, the problem
isn't your network

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,210
interactions.

8
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,440
It might be that you just have
some slow code that's running

9
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,320
on the browser side.

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,550
To optimize that, you can use
two tools we're looking at in

11
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:30,440
this level called the Frames
View and the CPU Profiler.

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,110
If you're a gamer like me,
you've probably heard of the

13
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,800
term frame rate.

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,630
This refers to the number of
images that gets rendered on

15
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,250
your screen per second.

16
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,090
So if I have a frame rate of 30
FPS, or frames per second,

17
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,080
that means there's 30 different
images that are

18
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,920
getting drawn onto my
screen per second.

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,930
And as my computer slows down,
it slows the rendering time

20
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,740
down, which means I might be
getting less frames per second

21
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,170
and it might start to stutter.

22
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,740
Especially as it gets below 10
frames per second, you're

23
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,550
definitely going to
be able to see it.

24
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,770
Even your browser has a frame
rate, and it can be slowed

25
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,360
down by things like JavaScript
execution, rendering of your

26
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,390
styles, and painting the
rendered page onto the screen.

27
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,580
This is where the Frames View
comes in, telling you when and

28
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,640
where your frame rate is
starting to suffer.

29
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,140
I've modified the Event Creation
button so now it has

30
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,270
an animation whenever
we create an event.

31
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:33,730
Let's see if that has any impact
on our frame rate.

32
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,250
So I'm going to open up the
Timeline tab and go to the

33
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,620
Frames menu.

34
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,920
We can record our frame timeline
by clicking on the

35
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,160
Record button here at the
bottom of the screen.

36
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,090
Now, let's try adding
a new event.

37
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:49,200
We click on the Event button,
try typing a name, click to

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,990
add, and there's our little
slide down animation.

39
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,520
As new events fire, our timeline
is updated, showing

40
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,560
how long each frame
took to render.

41
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,240
The ones that are under that
bottom line are around 16

42
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,580
milliseconds.

43
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,850
If each frame is 16
milliseconds, you can fit

44
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,020
about 60 frames per second,
which is a reading that you

45
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,800
see here on the right hand
side of our timeline.

46
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,910
It says 60 FPS or Frames
Per Second.

47
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,860
The second marker above
this says 30 FPS, or

48
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,650
30 Frames Per Second.

49
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:25,600
So if a frame takes longer than
33.3 milliseconds to run,

50
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,050
well, it's going to be above
that line and we're going to

51
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,300
see this huge bar, which
is not good.

52
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,620
Notice at the bottom of the
screen, we have check boxes

53
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,460
with Loading in blue, Scripting
in yellow, Rendering

54
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,630
in purple, and Painting
in green.

55
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,560
These are the colors you see
represented on the timeline.

56
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,070
This page was already loaded
when we started recording, so

57
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,590
there's not much blue, or HTML,
loading in our timeline.

58
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,400
We do have some JavaScript which
we can see in yellow.

59
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,210
And of course, the purple is the
rendering of the page or

60
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,460
the time we spent on style
recalculation and layout.

61
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,870
The transparent part of each bar
is the time spent idling

62
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,430
or on other uncategorized
tasks.

63
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,050
Low frame rates or laggy
animation can lead to a bad

64
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,720
user experience of an otherwise
beautiful web page,

65
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,360
so it's important to keep
an eye on this.

66
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,760
And so far, it looks like our
page here is loading under

67
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,580
this 60 frames per
second line.

68
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,970
Let's switch to the
next calendar day

69
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,220
and see what happens.

70
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,860
Whoa, you see that yellow
bar over there?

71
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,240
Not so good--

72
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,800
definitely less than 30
frames per second.

73
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,430
The color suggests that
JavaScript here is the

74
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,190
culprit, but there's a lot of
JavaScript in our application.

75
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,150
To narrow our search, we're
going to need the CPU

76
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,130
Profiler, which we're going to
get into in the next video.

77
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,500
But for now, why don't you jump
in to the challenges and

78
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,350
get familiar with
the Frames View.
