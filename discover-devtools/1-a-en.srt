1
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,680
If you've been a web developer
for a while, odds are you

2
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,120
remember the bad, old days of
web-development debugging.

3
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,350
If you get a JavaScript error in
your web page, well, maybe

4
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,210
the browser gives you a line
number, maybe it doesn't.

5
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,020
And maybe that line number
brings you to where the error

6
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,740
actually happened.

7
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,900
Same thing goes for style
sheet debugging.

8
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,920
You have a CSS property,
and why isn't it

9
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,930
showing up on the page?

10
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,880
Well, you go back to your file,
you update it, check the

11
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,910
browser, back to the file,
update it, check your browser.

12
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,750
Luckily, these days, we have
Chrome Developer Tools.

13
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,300
Developer Tools allows you to do
things like live edit your

14
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,320
HTML and CSS right there
in the page.

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,390
It comes with a powerful
JavaScript debugger and also a

16
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,660
bunch of tools to optimize
your website performance.

17
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:14,330
It makes programming for the
web, dare I say, easy.

18
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,090
I'm Greg Pollack.

19
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,640
And in this course, we're going
to be walking through

20
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,780
all the major features of
Chrome Developer Tools.

21
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,640
Now we're going to start with
some of the basics, which you

22
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,090
already may be familiar with.

23
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,620
So feel free to skip ahead to
the next couple chapters to

24
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,380
get into the more advanced
material.

25
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,560
Meanwhile, Level One, we're
going to be jumping into the

26
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,800
Elements panel.

27
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,030
Throughout the videos and the
challenges, we're going to be

28
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,280
working with the Scheduling app,
which we've been working

29
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,750
on that you can see here.

30
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,690
But we want to make some changes
to this application.

31
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,890
First thing we want to do
is open Developer Tools.

32
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,220
To do that, we look for the icon
on our browser with the

33
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,830
three lines on it.

34
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,770
Then find the Tools menu
item, then click on

35
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,490
the Developer Tools.

36
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,150
If you're not already familiar
with the keyboard shortcut to

37
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,010
call up Developer Tools and to
close Developer Tools from

38
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,550
within your browser, take
note of it here listed

39
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,960
next to the menu item.

40
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,670
It'll be much more convenient to
open it using that keyboard

41
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,560
chart next time.

42
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,900
By default, DevTools will appear
at the bottom part of

43
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,790
your Chrome window, and we can
close it at any time, either

44
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,720
by clicking that X icon in the
top left or simply by using

45
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,970
our keyboard shortcut.

46
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:23,100
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,860
So here is our Calendar
application.

47
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,500
We want to make some changes to
the HTML structure of it.

48
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,590
Now we could go back on to our
server and make the changes

49
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,840
there and then refresh our
browser, but maybe we just

50
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,640
want to play around and
live edit the page.

51
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,870
To do that, we want to make
sure we're in the Elements

52
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,350
panel you see here.

53
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,710
In this panel, you can see a
bunch of HTML on the left side

54
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,340
and a bunch of CSS
on the right.

55
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,140
But what you're really seeing
there on the left side is a

56
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,010
representation of the DOM or
Document Object Model.

57
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,260
You can think of it as a
collection of the different

58
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,050
elements in your HTML put into
sort of a tree format.

59
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,500
So if you want, you can press
on those little triangle

60
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,370
shapes, and it'll show you
more or less code in that

61
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,940
document tree.

62
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,050
If you're looking at your
rendered HTML page, and you're

63
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,980
wondering, well, what HTML
created that particular

64
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,820
element, what you can do is
right click on the element--

65
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,160
in our case, we're going to
right click on the button--

66
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,730
and select Inspect Element.

67
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,840
As we open the Elements panel,
if we don't already have it

68
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,840
open, and show us that
particular element highlighted

69
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,930
inside the DOM.

70
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,530
You might also notice that it's
showing us the CSS for

71
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,830
that element on the right side,
but we'll get more into

72
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,500
that in the next level.

73
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,720
Another way you can select an
element is by clicking the

74
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,470
magnifying glass in the bottom
left of the screen to enter

75
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,470
the Element Selection mode.

76
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,580
Then when you hover over the
page, you can see the

77
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,090
different element boundaries.

78
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,140
And when you left click on
one, it will select that

79
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,340
element in the Elements panel.

80
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,170
Now let's go ahead and make
some live changes.

81
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,620
For example, let's change
the text on our button.

82
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,250
To change that text, all we have
to do is double click on

83
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,600
it, type a new title, and then
we can just hit Enter when

84
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,160
we're done or click somewhere
else on the page.

85
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,330
If we right click on a
particular element, we're

86
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,710
given a bunch of different
options, including the ability

87
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,940
to add or edit attributes.

88
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,540
Let's go ahead and add an ID
attribute to this element.

89
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,910
Pretty easy.

90
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,140
Also in this menu, we can choose
to edit a node as HTML,

91
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,780
where we can change any part
of the element or add

92
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,030
additional elements.

93
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,340
Finally, if we click and drag an
element, we can change its

94
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,610
location on the page.

95
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,490
It shouldn't come as a surprise
that you can select

96
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,160
any element and hit the Delete
button to remove that element

97
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,950
or even right click and select
the Delete menu item.

98
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,840
Well, now it's time for you to
practice using some of these

99
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,090
techniques in the Challenges.
