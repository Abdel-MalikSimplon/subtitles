1
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,350
Now let's take a look at an
error that might pop up when

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,920
we read data from
local storage.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,010
So here you can see I refreshed
the page, an

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,160
error popped up.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,890
It looks like our application's
trying to call

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:18,340
the two lowercase method on
a value that's undefined.

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,300
If we refresh the page again,
you can see that it's paused

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,420
on our exception.

9
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,240
And if we hover over the name
for our event, we can see that

10
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,600
it is, in fact, undefined.

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,430
So what's going on here?

12
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,670
Well, let's take a look at our
events in local storage.

13
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,170
To do that, we'll first
have to click on

14
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,600
the Resources panel.

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,750
Then we can bring up storage for
the app on our development

16
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,740
machine by clicking
in the list here.

17
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,970
On the right, we can see our
stored items sorted by Key.

18
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,900
And there's our event, JSON.

19
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,090
It looks like our first event
has both a name and a date

20
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,210
attribute, but our second
only has a date.

21
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,380
So let's try adding
a name to it.

22
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,490
Now when we refresh the page, it
loads successfully because

23
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,430
our name is no longer null.

24
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:05,660
All right.

25
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,850
Now that we've shown you some
of the capabilities of the

26
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,950
DevTools debugger, it's time for
you to try it yourself in

27
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,200
the Challenges.
