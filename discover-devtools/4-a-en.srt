You're watching Discover
DevTools.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,230
I'm Greg Pollack, and this is
Level Four, where we're going

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,980
to be taking a closer look at
debugging our applications.

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,790
As we saw in the last chapter,
the Chrome console will log

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:16,239
out any errors that our
application throws.

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,790
However, Chrome also comes
with some great debugging

8
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:22,350
tools so you can dive deeper
into these errors.

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,600
In the last chapter, you may
remember that we were getting

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,220
an error page when
we loaded it.

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,690
The events method was
returning null.

12
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,680
Let's try to fix that directly
in our code by checking to see

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,680
if events is equal to null, and
if it is, we'll set it to

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,930
an empty array.

15
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,530
With that done, if we go back
and refresh the page, we'll

16
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,080
see that our page loads
without errors.

17
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,000
Why don't you try this over
on the Challenges?
