1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:04,210
Now that we're familiar with
the Network panel, let's

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,810
figure out some things we can
do to speed up our web page.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,060
Google has created a helpful
extension called PageSpeed.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,280
This tool analyzes our
application and makes

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,480
suggestions for how we
can speed it up.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,020
Just search for it
in the Chrome Web

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,630
Store to install it.

8
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,570
Once we have it installed, to
run it on our web page we'll

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,390
load up our page, click on the
new PageSpeed panel that we

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,865
have here, and click the button
to start analyzing.

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,430
PageSpeed will download our page
and run several automated

12
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,280
checks against it.

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,630
Looks like we've got
an initial score

14
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,510
of 79 out of 100.

15
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,630
Not bad, but we can definitely
do better.

16
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,980
Let's see if we can
pull up our grade.

17
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,300
We'll start with the item with
the highest priority,

18
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,040
minifying the JavaScript.

19
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,540
Currently, our application is
loading three JavaScript

20
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,630
files, as you can see here.

21
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,170
We can see how big they are by
looking over on the Network

22
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,050
tab, and together, they have
a size over 160 kilobytes.

23
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,220
They are fairly big.

24
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,950
They also require us to make
three separate requests to the

25
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,620
server, which also
isn't optimal.

26
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,510
The first optimization we can
make to each of these

27
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,430
JavaScript files is to
minify each of them.

28
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,200
This is going to remove extra
white space, reduce long

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,030
parameter names, and make other
optimizations to the

30
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,410
files to make them smaller.

31
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,950
Here you can see some code up
top that hasn't been minified.

32
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,100
Then, after minifying it, you
can see the code is going to

33
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,570
function the same but now it's
less characters, which is good

34
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,350
for speeding up your
page load time.

35
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,540
The next thing we can do is
take our three JavaScript

36
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,160
files and put them all
into one file.

37
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,580
Now the size is going to be
the same, whether it's in

38
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,550
three files or in one big one,
but it's only going to take

39
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,630
one network request to load
that file into our browser

40
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,370
rather than three.

41
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,610
And browsers themselves are
actually limited the number of

42
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,100
network requests they
can do at the same

43
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,580
time for a web page.

44
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,840
So obviously, the less network
requests our page has to do,

45
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,190
the faster it's going to load.

46
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,190
There are many different
libraries you can use to

47
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,260
combine your JavaScripts and
to minify them, but we're

48
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,550
going to use Google's
Closure Library.

49
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,950
Below this video, you'll find
a link to the official web

50
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,680
page to download this library.

51
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,220
You can download it in the form
of a Java JAR, and then

52
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,100
just run it from
your terminal.

53
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,370
We can also minify and combine
our JavaScript files using

54
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,390
this web app created by the
Google Closure team.

55
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,550
In order to use it, we need
to get the URLs of our

56
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,710
JavaScripts.

57
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,190
Now assuming your web app is
like ours and it's available

58
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,010
at a public URL, we can easily
get these JavaScript URLs by

59
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,060
going into our Network panel
and right clicking on each

60
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:42,080
JavaScript file name and
selecting Copy Link Address.

61
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,140
Then we'll just paste this
address into the Closure

62
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,730
Compiler and click Add.

63
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,270
We'll then go back and get the
next file, copy its address

64
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,640
and paste it, and repeat
for the third one.

65
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,520
Once we have all our files in
place, we click on the Compile

66
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,353
button, give it a few seconds,
and on the right side, you'll

67
00:03:04,353 --> 00:03:06,840
be shown your minified
JavaScript and a link where

68
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,430
you can download the
compressed file.

69
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,000
We'll go ahead and save this and
change the name from the

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,150
default to app-min, meaning
minified, and save it to our

71
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,830
app folder.

72
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,700
Now we just need to replace
our old JavaScript sources

73
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,820
with this new source,
just like that.

74
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,060
Previously, to load our
JavaScript for this web page,

75
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,570
we had to load three files
totaling 160 kilobytes.

76
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,710
Now in our new version, we only
need to make one request

77
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,630
for 110 kilobytes.

78
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,780
That's a pretty nice savings.

79
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,810
Now it's time for you to jump
into a challenge and start

80
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,060
making some page optimizations.
