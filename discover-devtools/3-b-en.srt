1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:03,840
So here we are back in our
Calendar application.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,255
We've got the console panel
open, and you'll notice when

3
00:00:06,255 --> 00:00:09,290
we refresh the page, we're
going to get an error.

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,830
We can learn more about what
caused this error by clicking

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,290
on the little triangle next to
it, and it'll show us a stack

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,110
trace of the calls that led to
the error, along with a file

7
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,580
name and line number.

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,180
If we click that line number,
the JavaScript file will open

9
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,000
up over in our Sources panel,
and we're brought right to the

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,380
line number where the error
occurred and even shown the

11
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,570
error message itself
right here.

12
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,000
If you take a read through the
JavaScript, it looks like

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,240
we're trying to call
the length property

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,450
on the events array.

15
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,540
But according to our error, the
events array is null, and,

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,090
obviously, you can't call
length on a null object.

17
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,970
So what's setting the
events array?

18
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,300
Well, it looks like the events
variable gets set when we call

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,680
calendar.events.

20
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,900
So it must be that method
which is returning null.

21
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,340
Here it might be useful to test
to see if that method is

22
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,790
actually returning
a null array.

23
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,390
Let's jump into the console
and run the command.

24
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,890
To open up the console this
time, we're simply going to

25
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,880
click this icon in
the lower left.

26
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,600
It's a little bit
of a shortcut.

27
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,690
Now I can make a quick call to
calendar.events, and yep, it's

28
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,550
returning null.

29
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,530
So we know where our
problem lies.

30
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,550
The function here is returning
null because we

31
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,840
don't have any events.

32
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,010
But we're going to want to
change this code so that if it

33
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,150
doesn't have any events, instead
it just returns an

34
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,640
empty array, which we'll get
into in the next chapter.

35
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,770
But for now, let's jump into
some more challenges.
