1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,640
Welcome back.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,020
It's always a best practice
to create a README.md

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,220
file in the root
directory of your project.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,050
It allows you to tell people
what the project's about,

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,270
why they should use it,
and how to install it,

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,170
and even how to
contribute back to it.

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,990
But as your project gets
larger and more complex,

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,680
eventually the
README file is going

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,317
to get a little too
large to work with.

10
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,900
When that happens,
you should consider

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,940
setting up and GitHub Wiki
to provide more information

12
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,710
about the project you've built.

13
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,230
You may have noticed
earlier, enabling

14
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,260
wikis for a project is
done on the same page

15
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,560
as enabling issues.

16
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,000
You just go to
Settings, Options,

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,190
and under Features make sure to
check the box next to wikis.

18
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,180
There's an extra
option for wikis which

19
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,870
allows you to restrict editing
on a public repository only

20
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:53,987
to collaborators.

21
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:56,320
So if you don't want everyone
changing the documentation

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,260
for your project, make
sure to check that box.

23
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,420
Let's say you want to add
a wiki to your project.

24
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,260
Start by clicking on the
Wiki tab on the right.

25
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,470
And you'll see that it gives
you a welcome page to the wiki,

26
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:12,580
and asks you to click a button
to create your initial page.

27
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,600
When you click that button,
it'll give you a form.

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,460
By default, it'll set the
title for the page to Home,

29
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,540
but you can change
that if you want.

30
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,140
And then it gives
you a text area

31
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,480
where you can enter the
content for that initial page.

32
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,960
Creating links is really easy.

33
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,450
You just click on
the Link button.

34
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,280
And then insert the
link text, which

35
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,520
can be any description you want,
and the URL, which is either

36
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,400
going to be the name of another
page on the wiki or a full URL

37
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,730
if it wants to be a link to
something outside of your wiki.

38
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,352
There were a number of
buttons above the text area

39
00:01:51,352 --> 00:01:52,560
when you're entering content.

40
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,980
You can use these to create
headings, links, bolds,

41
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,920
italics, and the like.

42
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,990
But this isn't a WIZIWIG editor.

43
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,020
All it's going to do is
generate Markdown for you.

44
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,610
So instead, use these if you
can't remember the Markdown.

45
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,560
But once you've used
them a few times,

46
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,040
you'll probably just
start typing the Markdown

47
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,560
straight into the text area.

48
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:20,310
The Markdown we work with in
README files and in the wiki

49
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,040
is GitHub Flavored Markdown.

50
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,900
If you're new to
Markdown you'll obviously

51
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,010
want to learn the
basics of this.

52
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,650
But even if you've been using
Markdown for a number of years

53
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,020
in other projects, take
the time to go to the URL

54
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,040
at the bottom of this
screen and learn more

55
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,350
about GitHub Flavored
Markdown, because there

56
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,220
are a number of
specific differences,

57
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,175
compared to other flavors
of Markdown that exist.

58
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,430
One thing you might want to add
to your wiki is status badges.

59
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,600
Here's an example in
the Rails Arel Project,

60
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,200
where we're seeing
badges to show

61
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,660
that the build is currently
passing in Travis CI,

62
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,460
and that the dependencies
are all up to date,

63
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,980
according to Gemnasium.

64
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,680
We're really just
putting images in here.

65
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,620
But those images get
updated by those projects.

66
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,390
So it's a really easy
way to dynamically show

67
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,080
the state of your
project in your wiki.

68
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,780
This is a general feature
of GitHub Markdown.

69
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,950
And it can be used in
wikis or in README files.

70
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,300
In fact, the example,
we're using here comes

71
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,220
from the Arel README file,
rather than its wiki.

72
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,870
So let's look at the
process of building a wiki.

73
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,730
The first thing we do is
click on the "Wiki" tab,

74
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,310
and it's going to say,
Welcome to your wiki.

75
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,500
Create the first page.

76
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,480
Click on the link,
and all you need to do

77
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,755
is go into the content area
and add some information.

78
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,245
Once you're done with
that, click on "Save Page."

79
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,780
And notice the little
metadata is stored here

80
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,020
about who made the change
and when it was made.

81
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,230
Now let's add a new page,
because the whole power wiki's

82
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,920
is linking across
multiple pages.

83
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,240
We can give it a title,
enter a description,

84
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,710
and when we're
done, save the page.

85
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,580
Now let's go back
to the home page

86
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,480
and create a link
to our new page.

87
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,019
And to do that,
all we need to do

88
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,649
is type the text before the
link, click on the link button,

89
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:24,380
and enter the description we
want for the link and the page

90
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,890
it should link to.

91
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,830
And notice, we can just go in
and change that description,

92
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,840
for example.

93
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,560
It's just a text file.

94
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,760
Now when we go to the home page,
after saving that page,

95
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,030
we can click on
that link and see

96
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,770
that it takes us to
our new Rules page.

97
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,710
You'll also notice that
all of the pages we add

98
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,305
are added to a navigation box
on the right of the wiki page.

99
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,150
So have fun playing
with you wikis

100
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,200
and I'll see you in
the next section.
