00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,080
Welcome back.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,030
In this section we're going to
go through forking and cloning.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:08,960
If you're already familiar
with both of those,

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,210
you might want to just skip
ahead to the challenges.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,600
When you create a new
repository on GitHub,

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,720
the first thing you're going
to want to do is clone that so

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,140
that you're downloading
a copy of the repository

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,630
to your local machine.

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,490
And then you can make changes
locally and push those

10
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,130
back up to GitHub.

11
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,590
If someone else has
created a project on GitHub

12
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,940
and they've added you
as a collaborator,

13
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,450
again, you can just clone
a copy of the repository,

14
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,110
make any changes you want,
and push them back up.

15
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,060
Because they've given
you permission to do so.

16
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,870
However, if someone's created
a public repository on GitHub

17
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,430
and they've not added
you as a collaborator,

18
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,040
you can still clone
that repository

19
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,470
to make a local copy.

20
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,250
You could use the files.

21
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,769
You can commit and
make changes locally,

22
00:00:55,769 --> 00:00:58,060
but you're not going to be
able to push your changes up

23
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,740
to GitHub because you don't
have the permission to do so.

24
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,000
So the question is, how do you
collaborate on a repository

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,450
that you don't have
permission to push to?

26
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:11,380
Well, the answer is, you
create a fork of the project.

27
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,370
When you create a fork,
you're creating your own copy

28
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,410
of the repository,
still up on GitHub,

29
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,140
but under your username,
or organization name

30
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,470
if you're running
an organization.

31
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,080
And what this does is it
creates a copy on GitHub

32
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,060
that you have full
permissions to.

33
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,070
So now you can then
clone that copy,

34
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,160
make changes locally, commit
them, and push them up

35
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,630
to your fork.

36
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,860
Notice that I'm looking
here at the dojo rules

37
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,220
repository, which is owned
by the deadlyvipers.

38
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,790
If I want to make a
change to this repository

39
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,670
I'm going to have to fork it
so that I have my own copy.

40
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,560
So let's look at that process.

41
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,060
I'm going to go click the
fork button in the top right.

42
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,800
Then I'm going to choose
where to fork it to.

43
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,010
In this case, I'm going to
fork it to my personal account.

44
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,370
Once the fork is made,
notice that now there's

45
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:13,252
a new copy of the repository
at my username slash repo name.

46
00:02:13,252 --> 00:02:14,710
And now that I've
forked it, I just

47
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,300
need to clone it, to
download it to my laptop.

48
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,870
So I'm going to copy the clone
url, go into a terminal window,

49
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,870
and clone the repository.

50
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,620
And now I can go in
here and make changes.

51
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,080
I could open up a
file, and I could

52
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,020
make some changes
to edit that file.

53
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,470
Once I've made my changes I can
add and commit those to Git.

54
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,760
And because I'm
pulling from a fork,

55
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,980
I can now push my changes
back up to my fork.

56
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,500
And I'll see that when
I go back to the fork

57
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,720
and look at the list of commits,
I'll see my commit right there.

58
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,310
Now it's time for you
to go fork a repo,

59
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,850
and I'll see you
in the next video.
