00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,336
Welcome to Level Four of
Assembling Sass: Extend.

3
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:38,700
In this level, we'll be talking
about the extend

4
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,470
directive, pitfalls associated
with it, and

5
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,690
the placeholder selector.

6
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,020
Remember this bit of button code
back in the mixin

7
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,400
level?

8
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,480
So we have btn-a and btn-b,
and the problem was that

9
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,590
they share three of the same
properties in both instances.

10
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,860
So we said we were able
to simplify it using a

11
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,090
comma-separated selector.

12
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:01,020
We can have Sass instead track
and combine these selectors

13
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,870
for us using the extend
directive.

14
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,330
We define btn-a as usual with
its inherent properties.

15
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,070
But then inside of btn-b,
we use the extend directive

16
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,190
followed by the selector we'd
like to extend, in this case,

17
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,990
the btn-a class.

18
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,790
And when it compiles, it
compiles down to that

19
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,830
comma-delimited selector that
we were looking for.

20
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,500
Without the properties in each
declaration, here's how the

21
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,750
selector combination happens.

22
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,750
What happens when
we have nested

23
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,840
selectors and we use extend?

24
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,400
In this example, we're extending
content in our

25
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,870
callout declaration, but content
has an h2 scoped and

26
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,200
nested inside.

27
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,780
When this compiles, not only is
callout added to content,

28
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,430
but a scoped version
of h2 is also added

29
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,680
to callout, as well.

30
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,010
If we take out the properties,
here's how that selector

31
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,260
combination works.

32
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,530
Extend is incredibly powerful
in that we can combine

33
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,170
selectors with like styles for
anywhere in our style sheet,

34
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,030
but it has some inherent
problems that

35
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,530
come along with this.

36
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,470
Here we have our btn-b
extending our btn-a, but

37
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,320
later on, we might want to scope
a change to btn-a

38
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,850
like sidebar here.

39
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:20,110
So sidebar has a scoped version
of btn-a and

40
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,140
changes btn-a. But since
btn-b extends btn-a,

41
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,830
when it compiles, that change
to btn-a also extends to

42
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,060
btn-b, which may
not be desired.

43
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,910
Since btn-b is extending
btn-a, any changes you make

44
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,230
the btn-a will also be
changes made to btn-b. If

45
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,960
the selectors that are generated
aren't needed, we're

46
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,790
creating some stylesheet bloat,
but we can fix that

47
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,810
using placeholder selectors,
which we'll go

48
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,740
into in just a minute.

49
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,550
When I write Sass, I make sure
I always check the compiled

50
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:55,080
CSS output because we can't be
guaranteed that Sass is going

51
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,290
to output perfect
CSS every time.

52
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,140
Now let's learn about
placeholder selectors.

53
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,270
So placeholder selectors in
Sass are denoted by the

54
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,590
percent sign.

55
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,310
And they're sort of like
partials in that they can be

56
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,790
extended, but they never become
selectors of their own.

57
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,210
So back to our button code
where sidebar has a scope

58
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,840
change to btn-a. We can move
everything that's shared

59
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,690
by btn-a and btn-b up to a
button placeholder selector.

60
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:26,270
Then inside of btn-a and
btn-b extend that

61
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,440
placeholder selector so btn-b
is no longer directly

62
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,080
extending btn-a. And when
this compiles, that change to

63
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,310
btn-a inside of sidebar
doesn't carry over to btn-b.

64
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,410
Placeholder selectors are
extremely useful when it comes

65
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,870
to CSS styles we want to reuse
throughout our style sheet.

66
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,020
In this case, we have the HTML5
boilerplate version of

67
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,950
image replacement as a
placeholder selector and we're

68
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,340
able to extend it anywhere
we need it.

69
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,360
So when this compiles, only the
selectors that need to use

70
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,330
ir are comma separated
in the final output.

71
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,690
Take heed that versions of IE
prior to 9 have a hard limit

72
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,690
on the number of selectors
you can use in a file.

73
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,830
So if you're using lots of
extends and lots of imports,

74
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,940
you might reach the 4,095 total
selector output limit

75
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,810
that there is.

76
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,630
If you do, anything
beyond that is

77
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,260
just going to be ignored.

78
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,230
That does it for level four, so
it's time for you to write

79
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,350
your own extends.

80
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,650
I'll see you on the other
side of the challenges.
