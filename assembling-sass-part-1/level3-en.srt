00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:37,648
Welcome to Assembling Sass,
Level Three: Mixin. In Level

3
00:00:37,648 --> 00:00:40,668
Three, we'll be discussing how
to use and set mixins, as well

4
00:00:40,668 --> 00:00:42,318
as how to use arguments
with our mixins.

5
00:00:42,318 --> 00:00:44,908


6
00:00:44,908 --> 00:00:47,808
First up, let's take a look
at some normal CSS.

7
00:00:47,808 --> 00:00:49,808
Here we have a pair
of buttons.

8
00:00:49,808 --> 00:00:53,118
And this isn't very good CSS
because we have three

9
00:00:53,118 --> 00:00:56,424
repeating properties in
each declaration.

10
00:00:56,424 --> 00:01:00,338
To help combat these sources of
repetition in CSS, we can

11
00:01:00,338 --> 00:01:01,718
use a mixin.

12
00:01:01,718 --> 00:01:04,098
So a mixin starts with @mixin.

13
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:05,248
And then we give it a name.

14
00:01:05,248 --> 00:01:06,968
In this case, we'll
call it button.

15
00:01:06,968 --> 00:01:09,058
And then inside of the block,
we write whatever

16
00:01:09,058 --> 00:01:10,278
properties we like.

17
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,418
And in this case, we're going
to carry over the shared

18
00:01:12,418 --> 00:01:14,708
properties between those
two buttons.

19
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:17,448
Once we've defined our mixin,
we're able to use it by

20
00:01:17,448 --> 00:01:20,608
calling @include within any
statements we'd like.

21
00:01:20,608 --> 00:01:24,178
So I'm using @include inside of
btn-a, calling the name

22
00:01:24,178 --> 00:01:25,538
of our mixin.

23
00:01:25,538 --> 00:01:28,318
And when it compiles, the
properties that are within the

24
00:01:28,318 --> 00:01:31,098
button mixin are going to be
copied into our btn-a

25
00:01:31,098 --> 00:01:34,018
declaration.

26
00:01:34,018 --> 00:01:37,728
Similarly, in button b if I
also use @include, when it

27
00:01:37,728 --> 00:01:40,528
compiles down, those same
properties will be included in

28
00:01:40,528 --> 00:01:43,848
the btn-b declaration.

29
00:01:43,848 --> 00:01:46,208
When you're using mixins, make
sure that your mixin

30
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:49,788
declaration comes before these
includes, especially if you're

31
00:01:49,788 --> 00:01:52,338
importing files that have
mixins in them.

32
00:01:52,338 --> 00:01:55,168
If you try to use a mixin
without having it defined

33
00:01:55,168 --> 00:01:56,668
before the include,
Sass is going to

34
00:01:56,668 --> 00:01:59,038
throw an error at you.

35
00:01:59,038 --> 00:02:01,298
On another note, we're
using @include,

36
00:02:01,298 --> 00:02:02,808
that's calling a mixin.

37
00:02:02,808 --> 00:02:05,768
While @import, that we defined
earlier, is importing the

38
00:02:05,768 --> 00:02:09,578
contents of a file into
our Sass file.

39
00:02:09,578 --> 00:02:12,138
So looking back at the CSS we
generated in that previous

40
00:02:12,138 --> 00:02:15,138
example, while we've made it
easier for ourselves on the

41
00:02:15,138 --> 00:02:18,038
Sass side, the generated CSS
is still the same thing.

42
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:21,228
We're copying those same three
properties into both of our

43
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:24,918
buttons, and our CSS is
still not efficient.

44
00:02:24,918 --> 00:02:28,518
For now, it's easier to write
this as normal CSS using a

45
00:02:28,518 --> 00:02:31,148
comma-separated selector between
our two buttons for

46
00:02:31,148 --> 00:02:32,838
the shared properties.

47
00:02:32,838 --> 00:02:34,558
So let's stop for second here.

48
00:02:34,558 --> 00:02:37,688
I showed you an example, but
ultimately it wound up being a

49
00:02:37,688 --> 00:02:39,488
bad example of mixin.

50
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,848
In this case, what is a mixin
a really good for?

51
00:02:42,848 --> 00:02:45,138
Let's take a look at
this bit of CSS.

52
00:02:45,138 --> 00:02:47,158
We want to change our
box sizing property.

53
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:50,388
But to get the best coverage as
far as WebKit and Mozilla

54
00:02:50,388 --> 00:02:54,028
browsers, we have to include
those vendor prefixes.

55
00:02:54,028 --> 00:02:56,648
It can get old really quick if
every time we want to change

56
00:02:56,648 --> 00:02:59,118
box sizing we have to include
three things that

57
00:02:59,118 --> 00:03:00,888
are almost the same.

58
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:04,088
To combat this, we can start off
by defining a box-sizing

59
00:03:04,088 --> 00:03:06,988
mixin in the same way that we
defined that button mixin and

60
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:09,558
including all three
vendor prefixes.

61
00:03:09,558 --> 00:03:13,578
Then, within our content block
we can say @include

62
00:03:13,578 --> 00:03:16,738
box-sizing, and those properties
are copied over.

63
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,308
However, as we said before,
here we're just using the

64
00:03:19,308 --> 00:03:25,148
mixin to copy properties, it's
not an efficient use of CSS.

65
00:03:25,148 --> 00:03:28,838
The power of mixins comes from
our ability to pass arguments

66
00:03:28,838 --> 00:03:30,258
into the mixin.

67
00:03:30,258 --> 00:03:33,058
After we define the name of
the mixin, in this case,

68
00:03:33,058 --> 00:03:36,498
box-sizing, we can open and
close parentheses and pass in

69
00:03:36,498 --> 00:03:38,268
any arguments that we'd like.

70
00:03:38,268 --> 00:03:40,558
In this case, we'll call
our argument x.

71
00:03:40,558 --> 00:03:44,138
And then within the mixin, we
can go ahead and use x in any

72
00:03:44,138 --> 00:03:46,038
property we'd like.

73
00:03:46,038 --> 00:03:48,818
Now in our @content declaration,
we're going to

74
00:03:48,818 --> 00:03:51,128
@include our box-sizing mixin.

75
00:03:51,128 --> 00:03:54,448
We pass border box as a
string into the mixin.

76
00:03:54,448 --> 00:03:56,858
Border-box is set
as the x value.

77
00:03:56,858 --> 00:03:59,868
And then everything inside of
the mixin is output into our

78
00:03:59,868 --> 00:04:01,948
content declaration.

79
00:04:01,948 --> 00:04:04,598
So now we have an appropriate
use of mixin.

80
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:08,328
We can define a callout, use
@include box-sizing, and pass

81
00:04:08,328 --> 00:04:12,518
content-box, a second possible
value for box-sizing, and when

82
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:15,293
that outputs, it uses that
value as x instead.

83
00:04:15,293 --> 00:04:19,238


84
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:21,918
Taking our argument passing one
step further, we're able

85
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,318
to define default values
if we'd like.

86
00:04:25,318 --> 00:04:28,598
Looking back at our box-sizing
mixin, we can add a colon to

87
00:04:28,598 --> 00:04:31,528
the end of our x argument and
then add the string of

88
00:04:31,528 --> 00:04:32,928
border-box.

89
00:04:32,928 --> 00:04:35,688
If nothing is passed for x, then
border-box will be used

90
00:04:35,688 --> 00:04:37,848
by default.

91
00:04:37,848 --> 00:04:40,438
Now with our content
declaration, if we simply

92
00:04:40,438 --> 00:04:43,318
include box-sizing and don't
pass an argument, the

93
00:04:43,318 --> 00:04:47,158
border-box value is used by
default, and it outputs using

94
00:04:47,158 --> 00:04:48,408
that value.

95
00:04:48,408 --> 00:04:52,018


96
00:04:52,018 --> 00:04:55,398
With our callout declaration,
however, we have to still pass

97
00:04:55,398 --> 00:04:59,108
content-box as an argument for
it to be output like before.

98
00:04:59,108 --> 00:05:03,648
And as you can see, this
overrides the default.

99
00:05:03,648 --> 00:05:06,648
Let's continue adding complexity
to our arguments by

100
00:05:06,648 --> 00:05:08,828
adding more than one.

101
00:05:08,828 --> 00:05:11,548
By using a comma-separated list,
we can pass more than

102
00:05:11,548 --> 00:05:13,558
one thing into a mixin.

103
00:05:13,558 --> 00:05:16,328
Then, we use that mixin in
with our @include, we'll

104
00:05:16,328 --> 00:05:19,678
simply use a comma-separated
list of arguments to pass more

105
00:05:19,678 --> 00:05:23,088
than one thing ultimately
to our mixin.

106
00:05:23,088 --> 00:05:26,238
Here, you can see our mixin call
here took two parameters

107
00:05:26,238 --> 00:05:30,160
and then used them
both for output.

108
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,548
And for some reason, we call our
mixin, but don't include

109
00:05:33,548 --> 00:05:36,808
the total number of arguments
that the mixin is expecting.

110
00:05:36,808 --> 00:05:38,678
It's going to throw an error
at us when we compile.

111
00:05:38,678 --> 00:05:42,428


112
00:05:42,428 --> 00:05:44,798
If we go ahead and add a default
value to our second

113
00:05:44,798 --> 00:05:47,288
argument, when we call the mixin
we aren't required to

114
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:49,088
include all of those
values unless we

115
00:05:49,088 --> 00:05:51,088
want to override one.

116
00:05:51,088 --> 00:05:53,738
Now, as you can see, only
including one argument still

117
00:05:53,738 --> 00:05:57,388
allows us to compile, and the
default value is used where we

118
00:05:57,388 --> 00:06:00,988
didn't override it.

119
00:06:00,988 --> 00:06:03,978
When including default values
and creating optional

120
00:06:03,978 --> 00:06:07,098
arguments in our mixins, any
optional arguments need to

121
00:06:07,098 --> 00:06:09,748
come at the end of our
chain of arguments.

122
00:06:09,748 --> 00:06:13,078
Here, if we move our optional
argument up front and then try

123
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:15,578
to only pass one value, the
compiler is going to throw an

124
00:06:15,578 --> 00:06:16,828
error at us.

125
00:06:16,828 --> 00:06:20,428


126
00:06:20,428 --> 00:06:22,438
Let's go ahead and switch that
back around so that it works

127
00:06:22,438 --> 00:06:24,913
again, and talk about
keyword arguments.

128
00:06:24,913 --> 00:06:27,738
If we're passing more than one
argument into a mixin,

129
00:06:27,738 --> 00:06:30,068
sometimes it can get confusing
what order they're

130
00:06:30,068 --> 00:06:31,248
supposed to go in.

131
00:06:31,248 --> 00:06:32,918
And it's very finicky
if we pass things

132
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:34,188
in the wrong order.

133
00:06:34,188 --> 00:06:37,588
We can use the values of the
arguments in our mixin to

134
00:06:37,588 --> 00:06:41,338
create key value pairs
in our call like so.

135
00:06:41,338 --> 00:06:43,628
And this allows these keyword
arguments to be

136
00:06:43,628 --> 00:06:44,878
passed in any order.

137
00:06:44,878 --> 00:06:48,918


138
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:51,778
Some CSS can be problematic
when defining multiple

139
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:52,918
arguments however.

140
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:54,828
Here we have the transition
property.

141
00:06:54,828 --> 00:06:57,248
And in the transition property,
it's possible to

142
00:06:57,248 --> 00:07:00,428
have commas separating different
input values for

143
00:07:00,428 --> 00:07:02,998
transition.

144
00:07:02,998 --> 00:07:07,118
If we try to pass these
comma-separated valid CSS

145
00:07:07,118 --> 00:07:10,438
values into mixins, we're going
to run into some issues.

146
00:07:10,438 --> 00:07:13,458
First up, we'll write a
transition mixin similar to

147
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:17,178
our box-sizing mixin that takes
care of any browser

148
00:07:17,178 --> 00:07:19,338
prefixes that we might have.

149
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:23,088
Then, if we try to include that
comma-separated CSS value

150
00:07:23,088 --> 00:07:25,778
we showed on the previous slide,
it's going to have a

151
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,918
bit of a problem.

152
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:29,198
It thinks we're passing two
arguments, even though we're

153
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,018
only passing one, because
of the comma.

154
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:34,268


155
00:07:34,268 --> 00:07:36,608
To fix this, we can create
a variable argument.

156
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:39,938
So to create a variable argument
in Sass, we had three

157
00:07:39,938 --> 00:07:42,858
dots to the end of the argument
definition in the

158
00:07:42,858 --> 00:07:44,578
mixin definition.

159
00:07:44,578 --> 00:07:46,848
Here we'll three dots
to the end of val.

160
00:07:46,848 --> 00:07:49,748
And when we pass that
comma-separated value into the

161
00:07:49,748 --> 00:07:52,048
mixin, it uses it as a single

162
00:07:52,048 --> 00:07:53,618
argument and outputs correctly.

163
00:07:53,618 --> 00:07:57,558


164
00:07:57,558 --> 00:08:01,278
We're also able to make use of
variable arguments in reverse.

165
00:08:01,278 --> 00:08:03,018
Here we're looking back
at that button

166
00:08:03,018 --> 00:08:04,888
mixin we defined before.

167
00:08:04,888 --> 00:08:07,588
And if we have a list variable
that we defined back

168
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:10,988
in Level Two that has two
values, comma-separated, we

169
00:08:10,988 --> 00:08:14,748
can pass that into our mixin
using a variable argument

170
00:08:14,748 --> 00:08:16,808
properties... 

171
00:08:16,808 --> 00:08:20,038
When it gets sent into the
mixin, the mixin will split

172
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:22,928
those values into their
applicable arguments and use

173
00:08:22,928 --> 00:08:24,178
them as necessary.

174
00:08:24,178 --> 00:08:27,848


175
00:08:27,848 --> 00:08:30,568
Let's take a look at some bad
mixin code and figure out how

176
00:08:30,568 --> 00:08:32,008
we can make it better.

177
00:08:32,008 --> 00:08:34,508
We have a mixin that allows
us to pass a color.

178
00:08:34,508 --> 00:08:37,218
And it changes that
side's border.

179
00:08:37,218 --> 00:08:40,548
Here we have three others that
allow us to change any side of

180
00:08:40,548 --> 00:08:43,068
a border we like based
on passing a color.

181
00:08:43,068 --> 00:08:45,958
So in our button declaration,
we're going to change the

182
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,648
right side border color based
on the argument we

183
00:08:48,648 --> 00:08:50,868
pass into the mixin.

184
00:08:50,868 --> 00:08:52,928
However, this is horribly
inefficient.

185
00:08:52,928 --> 00:08:56,128
We have a separate mixin for
each side of the border.

186
00:08:56,128 --> 00:08:59,148
Using interpolation that we
learned back in Level Two, we

187
00:08:59,148 --> 00:09:01,008
can clean this up a bit.

188
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:02,468
We're going to redefine
our highlight

189
00:09:02,468 --> 00:09:04,138
mixin simply as highlight.

190
00:09:04,138 --> 00:09:07,258
We'll continue to pass color as
an argument, but we're also

191
00:09:07,258 --> 00:09:09,368
going to add side
as an argument.

192
00:09:09,368 --> 00:09:12,258
Within our mixin, we can use
interpolation to interpolate

193
00:09:12,258 --> 00:09:14,778
the value of our side
argument into the

194
00:09:14,778 --> 00:09:17,898
border color property.

195
00:09:17,898 --> 00:09:20,798
Now when we use it within our
button, we'll pass which side

196
00:09:20,798 --> 00:09:21,988
we would like to change.

197
00:09:21,988 --> 00:09:25,268
And ultimately, we simply need
to pass the right string, then

198
00:09:25,268 --> 00:09:27,738
we have one mixin that
can handle any side

199
00:09:27,738 --> 00:09:28,988
of our border color.

200
00:09:28,988 --> 00:09:31,438


201
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:32,698
That does is for Level Three.

202
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:34,878
It's time for you write some
mixins of your own.

203
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:36,218
And I'll see you
in Level Four.

204
00:09:36,218 --> 00:09:37,468
Good luck.
