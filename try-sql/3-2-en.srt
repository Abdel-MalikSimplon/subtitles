00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,680
Welcome back to Try SQL
level three, section two.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,800
In this section, we'll show
you how to manipulate tables

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,770
within a database.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:16,230
So, how would we add, change,
or even remove an entire column

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,350
from an existing table?

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,550
Let's first start by
adding the ratings column

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,380
to our Movies table.

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,310
We do want to see how well
a movie is doing, right?

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,400
We have a new SQL recipe, which
we'll call the ALTER TABLE ADD

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,790
recipe.

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,580
We first give the ALTER
TABLE command, followed

12
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,720
by the table we want to change.

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,070
Next, we issue an
ADD COLUMN clause

14
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,710
stating that we want to add a
column to the indicated table.

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,990
This is followed by the name
of the new column and the data

16
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,220
type we want it to have.

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,920
So now if we take our
ALTER TABLE ADD recipe

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,500
and supply the
table name of movies

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,520
along with the new column named
ratings and a data type of INT,

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,019
here's what the SQL
code will look like.

21
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,560
We give the data type as
INT because we wish to rate

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,300
these films from 1 to 10.

23
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,960
We run this SQL statement
and see that the new column

24
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,650
ratings is now created.

25
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,370
But all the fields are empty.

26
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:22,840
Let's update these fields
with some actual data.

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,800
Since we currently have data
in the columns of the Chaplin

28
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,600
Theaters database, issuing
these separate UPDATE

29
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,930
commands will change only the
field in the ratings column.

30
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,000
We use the WHERE
clause to pinpoint

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,880
which title needs to get the
rating indicated by the set

32
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,110
keyword.

33
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,270
Then we'll execute
all of the statements

34
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:44,510
and find that our new
ratings column has

35
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,001
some data of its own.

36
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:46,500
Cool.

37
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,390
But what if we no
longer needed a column?

38
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:56,300
We can remove it by issuing
the ALTER TABLE DROP statement.

39
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,140
Let's drop or remove the
ratings column altogether.

40
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:05,020
The DROP COLUMN clause deletes
a column in an existing table.

41
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,509
As we see, no more ratings
column to be found.

42
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:09,255
Death to critics.

43
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,390
There are tons of other
great and useful things

44
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,510
we can use SQL for, but we'll
get to those in later courses.

45
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,850
For now, thanks for
joining us for Try SQL.

46
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,100
Let's finish strong and
complete these final challenges.

47
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,420
Thanks for using Code School.

48
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,850
We'll see you soon.

49
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,440
Column from — 

50
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,680
We'll see you in the next course.

51
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,190
Thank you for
joining Code School.

52
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,944
Welcome back to Try SQL.

53
00:02:37,944 --> 00:02:39,360
Let's get back to
trying some SQL.

54
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,805
This guy.

55
00:02:44,805 --> 00:02:47,990
I just — I just.
