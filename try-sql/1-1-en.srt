1
00:00:00,275 --> 00:00:01,750
[SINGING] Deep in
your app. there's

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:04,230
a space filled up
by a great database.

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,780
Its tables are where
information goes, made up of

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,390
cells inside columns and rows.

5
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,020
To speak to it, we can
connect using INSERT,

6
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,220
UPDATE, and SELECT.

7
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,270
With a language
that has no equal,

8
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,460
we need more people to Try SQL.

9
00:00:19,341 --> 00:00:19,840
SQL.

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,730
Welcome to Try SQL.

11
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,480
My name is Chari Clark,
and I look forward

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,980
to giving you some
key points on how

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,680
to use the database programming
language known as SQL.

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,370
This course is
designed to teach you

15
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,460
the basics on how
to read, write,

16
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,120
and program in the database
language known as SQL.

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,550
Let's begin with level
one, section one —

18
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,030
Understanding Databases.

19
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,370
So the story begins
with a question.

20
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,830
We want to see a movie
at the Gatsby Theaters,

21
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,470
but we're only interested
in seeing comedies.

22
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,020
How can we get the titles of
all the movies that are comedies

23
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,880
and what can we
use to get those?

24
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,444
Of course, we could use
the local newspapers.

25
00:01:01,444 --> 00:01:02,860
But there are so
many reasons that

26
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,475
make this not the
most convenient tool

27
00:01:04,475 --> 00:01:06,650
to use in today's society.

28
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,360
Instead, we could
look at a website

29
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,410
for reviewing current movie
listings and run times.

30
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,690
With today's technology,
the biggest difference

31
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,170
in these two forms of media
is that only one of these

32
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,130
can be continuously updated,
while the newspaper will

33
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,079
remain static.

34
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,370
This makes the use of the
web much better in keeping up

35
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,260
to date information about almost
anything we wish to find out.

36
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,690
But what is it exactly that
makes a website stay updated?

37
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:32,510
Well, this is because it's
being updated by a database.

38
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,990
A database collects and
organizes information

39
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,120
so that it can be
easily retrieved.

40
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,540
For example, the
movie listings website

41
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,380
goes to a database to request
the most current showtimes

42
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,250
for its theater.

43
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,790
Believe it or not, databases are
used in most of the technology

44
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,460
that we use every day.

45
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,600
And many different services —
such as email, GPS, Facebook,

46
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,000
our cell phones,
Twitter, and websites —

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,642
also use databases in
some form or another.

48
00:02:00,642 --> 00:02:03,100
We will be using a database to
solve some of these problems

49
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,130
that we will encounter
in this course.

50
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,600
The database that we'll use
is called the Gatsby Theaters

51
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,860
database, which has all
types of information.

52
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,250
But how is all this
information, such as movie info

53
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,100
and showtimes info, organized?

54
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,530
Our information or
data is organized

55
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,510
into what we call tables.

56
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,980
A table holds the data that
can be used in a database

57
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,350
and allows for it to
be easily retrieved.

58
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,420
The database holds four tables:

59
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,935
Movies, Concessions,
Showtimes, and Promotions.

60
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,200
So here's a question.

61
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,710
In order to look up
information on movies,

62
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,820
we would need to go
inside which database

63
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,940
and look inside which table?

64
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,840
As you can probably
see, we would

65
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,350
need to go inside the
Gatsby Theaters database

66
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,440
and look inside
the Movies table.

67
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,000
This is where we can
find our information.

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,800
Now, let's go a little
deeper and find out

69
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,670
what's inside the table.

70
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,930
We see the data from the website
but not quite in the same form.

71
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,700
What we actually see is the
same data stored and organized

72
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,370
into what's known
as cells or fields,

73
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,570
where each cell holds
a separate value that

74
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,860
can be accessed by a website.

75
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,030
These cells for each table
are organized into rows.

76
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,230
Basically, a row represents
an entire data record

77
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,780
within each table.

78
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,430
For example, we can look
at the first row of data

79
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,890
as having an ID of 1 with
a title of Metropolis,

80
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,640
and a genre of sci-fi, along
with having a duration of 153.

81
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,780
Each row is separate
from the next.

82
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,870
A table is also
made up of columns,

83
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,790
which hold similar data
for each separate value.

84
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,890
Each column is given
a descriptive name,

85
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,150
which describes the type of
data that can be found in it.

86
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:54,870
The four columns we have are
ID, title, genre, and duration.

87
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,530
Often, a table will have
some unique identifier, which

88
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,250
is used to order the rows.

89
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,240
Another name for this is the
primary key of the table.

90
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,880
Let's look at how to find
some data in our database.

91
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,460
Say, for example, we want
to find the value "Nosferatu."

92
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,130
How would we find this
value in our table?

93
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,260
To move through a
table in a database,

94
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,290
we should first
look at the columns.

95
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,200
We'll start with the ID column.

96
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,650
Since there are no
matching records here,

97
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,600
we move to the right
one column to find

98
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,880
that the matching record
is in the title column.

99
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,420
Next is to search by row.

100
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,910
Let's move through each
row in the column of title

101
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,660
and find Nosferatu.

102
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,370
We find that Nosferatu
is in the title column

103
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,920
and on the second row.

104
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,390
Generally, tables will contain
fewer columns than rows.

105
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:50,556
So, while the table may
have over a million rows,

106
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,430
it may have only a couple
of hundred columns.

107
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,980
The search path first moves
through the columns from left

108
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,870
to right.

109
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,000
And then we search the
rows from top to bottom.

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,096
That's all we have
for section one.

111
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,470
Now let's look at
some challenges

112
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,110
to help reinforce
these concepts.
