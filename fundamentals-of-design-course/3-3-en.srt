00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,600
In this last video on layout,
we're going to start by

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,580
talking about white space, and
white space is the empty space

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,020
around elements that can
increase readability and

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,390
create an air of elegance.

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,570
White space doesn't necessarily
have to be white.

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,410
Even on images with a strong
focal point, the plain area

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,210
around it is considered
white space.

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,620
White space in the design of a
website with a lot of content

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,630
can draw the user in without
overwhelming them.

11
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,020
Using white space at a high
level between major elements

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,710
in the design is essential,
but only if nuanced white

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,050
space between different elements
within individual

14
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,730
containers exists as well.

15
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,530
Finally, a good design is a
balanced design, and balance

16
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,090
is the equal distribution
of visual weight

17
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,080
throughout the design.

18
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,470
Designs that are not balanced
make us uncomfortable and can

19
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,890
have quite the disturbing
effect.

20
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,650
There are many different ways
to incorporate balance into

21
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,860
your website, and one
of them is symmetry.

22
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,460
Designs that need a more
stable and strong

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,450
organizational structure
tend to

24
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,470
incorporate a lot of symmetry.

25
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,030
This is the Envy Labs site.

26
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,880
You'll notice it uses a lot of
symmetry, because we're trying

27
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,800
to portray a sense of stability
and trust that will

28
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,980
win us new projects.

29
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,360
In the Beanstalk website,
there's an overall pattern of

30
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,110
symmetry that creates
a sense of balance.

31
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,950
Notice that the imagery does
not have to be in exact

32
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,920
reflection to be symmetrical.

33
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,250
Incorporating symmetry
into your design

34
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,180
is inherently balanced.

35
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,010
However, introducing
asymmetrical elements is

36
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:49,560
effective in drawing attention
and breaking monotony, though

37
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,070
it must still be balanced
on the page.

38
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,930
Let me show you what I mean.

39
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,400
Here, we have an unrepeated
large element that creates

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,590
asymmetry to grab attention and
create visual hierarchy

41
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,750
but, by adhering it to the
grid, brings a sense of

42
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,500
balance and order to the page.

43
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,720
Here's an example of asymmetry
demanding attention, creating

44
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,480
intrigue, and introducing white
space, and the density

45
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,160
on the other side of the page
gives it a sense of balance.

46
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,140
All of the principles that
we've talked about here

47
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,180
contribute to a sense
of balance.

48
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,980
Size, color, contrast, alignment
to the grid, white

49
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,400
space, or lack thereof, also
known as density, and symmetry

50
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,850
all work together to
create balance.

51
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,570
It's important to design
with intentionality.

52
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:44,840
If you can't defend the typeface
or the color or the

53
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,560
grid that you've chosen to
use for your project in a

54
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,730
conversational manner,
it probably

55
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,570
isn't the right choice.

56
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,240
Be able to know and talk about
why you make all the decisions

57
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,810
that you made.

58
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:01,330
One final note about design:
experiment often.

59
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,260
The first solution is
rarely the best one.

60
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,020
Don't rush the process and keep
trying different things

61
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,080
until you come up with the
best possible solution to

62
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,110
whatever design challenge
you are facing.

63
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,080
Now, it's time for a few
more challenges.

64
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,330
Good luck.

65
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,044
