1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,050

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,840
Now that you've learned how to
order elements on the page,

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,460
it's time to talk about how to
align them to a grid, which is

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,730
the structural guideline
for organizing

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,880
elements on the page.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,580
It is made up of a system of
horizontal and vertical lines

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,700
where the vertical lines create
columns with gutters in

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,860
between them that are used to
proportionally distribute

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,420
elements across the page, and the
horizontal lines are used

10
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,490
to create a baseline for text
that should be equal to the

11
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,610
line height.

12
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,610
Though baselines are
really difficult to

13
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,180
implement on the web -

14
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,620
the browser support
just isn't there -

15
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,030
use them in Photoshop or another
graphics software as a

16
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,640
reference when designing,
and do what you can

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,800
to carry them through.

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,270
The Apple store uses a grid
system to organize all of

19
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,620
their content.

20
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,410
When we overlay a system of
vertical lines, we can see

21
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:57,760
quite plainly the columns and
the gutters that they're using

22
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,010
to organize everything.

23
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,180

24
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,060
Grids come in many different
shapes and sizes.

25
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,100
The 960 grid system used to be
standard, but more and more

26
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,380
websites are leaving
behind fixed grids.

27
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,800
What do I mean by that?

28
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,930
With a fixed grid, the browser
can get bigger or smaller, and

29
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,200
the grid will remain constant.

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,720
But with a fluid grid, it grows
or shrinks with the

31
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,580
browser window, and columns are
either added or dropped to

32
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,500
better serve that size.

33
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,600
For simplicity's sake, in this
course, we're going to be

34
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,450
using a fixed grid.

35
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,380
Get used to working with a grid
here, but really do your

36
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,880
research and implement a fluid
grid in the wild, wild web.

37
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,120
You can use the grid to break
down your site into more

38
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,660
manageable chunks.

39
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:52,980
For instance, here we have six
columns grouped into halves, or

40
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,310
four columns grouped into thirds
or, further still,

41
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,965
three columns grouped
into quarters.

42
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:02,230

43
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,260
We can see that the Apple
store uses all three.

44
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:09,070
The very top row is broken down
into quarters with three

45
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,380
columns per element.

46
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,260
The second row is broken into
thirds with the main element

47
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,680
using up 2/3 of the width
and the other

48
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,920
element using one third.

49
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,180
Underneath that, we have six
columns grouped together to

50
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,950
create halves and so
on and so forth.

51
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,020
We can take all the elements
from the previous challenge

52
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,750
and lay them out on the grid,
giving order to the chaos.

53
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,480
And the grid is versatile
enough to accept all the

54
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,300
layouts we've made.

55
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,810
Also, avoid clutter by
respecting the gutters.

56
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,140
Don't put design elements or
type in between the columns.

57
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,320
Remember, we're establishing
visual relationships on behalf

58
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,520
of the user.

59
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,940
And by adhering to the grid,
we're creating relationships

60
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,620
between elements that make the
content easier to consume.

61
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,280
Now, try working with
the grid yourself.

62
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,919
