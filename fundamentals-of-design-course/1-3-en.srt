1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,110

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,840
Next up is line-width, which
is put simply as the

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,540
width of the line.

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,550
Lines that are too short are
difficult to read, as the

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,150
user's eye has to move quickly
from line to line.

6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,440
On the other side, lines that
are too long are also

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,220
difficult to read,
as the user's eye

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,660
can get lost easily.

9
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,780
Line-width is measured in CPL,
which stands for characters

10
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,760
per line, and 50 to 70
characters per line, including

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,910
spaces, is ideal.

12
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,040
Take, for instance, this
paragraph, which is set at 55

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,700
to 65 characters per line.

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,410
Note that if I were to increase
the type size, the

15
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,370
physical line with increases,
however, the characters per

16
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,000
line stays the same.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,930
In CSS, this is controlled using
the max-width property,

18
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,350
or maximum width.

19
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,710
The higher you set your
max-width, the more CPL you're

20
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,120
going to have.

21
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,490
The lower it is, the fewer
CPL you're going to have.

22
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,170
Let's take a look
at an example.

23
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,070
If we've got a browser window
that's 1,000 pixels wide, we'd

24
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:12,040
need to set our max-width at
about 630 pixels in order to

25
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,830
maintain 55 to 65 CPL
at 26 pixels.

26
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,210
However, when viewing it on a
mobile device, if the font

27
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,620
size stays at 26 pixels, the
CPL will drop down to 20 to

28
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,810
25, which is far more cramped
than is comfortable for

29
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,240
readability.

30
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,922
To solve this, you can drop
the font size down to 16

31
00:01:33,922 --> 00:01:38,200
pixels, which will give us a
CPL of closer to 30 to 40,

32
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,820
which is still not ideal, but
it's going to create a better

33
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,630
reading experience
for your user.

34
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,830
Let's take a look at
an example of this.

35
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,320
When looking at this website on
the desktop, the max width

36
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,390
is set to 730 pixels with a font
size of 22 pixels, which

37
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:59,170
averages 70 to 80 CPL.

38
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,350
However, when looking at it on
a mobile device, the width is

39
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:07,580
360 pixels, and the font size
drops down to 19 pixels in

40
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:12,840
order to maintain an average
CPL of 40 to 45.

41
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,540
This is a great example of
responsive design, which we

42
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,930
won't be going into
in this course.

43
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,690
However, there are plenty of
great resources out there,

44
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,470
including Code School's Journey
Into Mobile course.

45
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,330
I encourage you to
check those out.

46
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:30,110
And finally, Save the
Orphans & Widows.

47
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:36,900
A widow is a single word on a
line of text, and an orphan is

48
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,380
a single line of text
on a column or page.

49
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,020
And these are bad things,
because they impede the

50
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,330
natural flow of reading
for the user.

51
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,010
When dealing with orphans and
widows, know that there isn't

52
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,040
always a perfect solution.

53
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,150
Especially when dealing with
large blocks of content, they

54
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,360
can be very difficult
to prevent.

55
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,450
Try tweaking with the font size,
weight, line width, and

56
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,660
leading to fix the problem.

57
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,650
And at the very least,
make sure your

58
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,580
headlines are widow free.

59
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,160
Now try your hand at this last
set of typographical

60
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,410
challenges.

61
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,906
