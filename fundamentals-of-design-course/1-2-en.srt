1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,009

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,700
Once we've selected a font, the
next thing we need to do

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,130
is set the sizes in
our style guide.

4
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,100
Before we talk about that, I
want you to take a look at

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,750
these two objects.

6
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,780
Think to yourself, how would
you describe these?

7
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,700
Would you say, a blue
and a green square?

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,460
Or maybe a big and
a small square?

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,320
Chances are that the first thing
that came to mind was

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,740
not simply two squares.

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,800
And this is because humans
create relationships.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,850
It's how we process things.

13
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:35,000
We relate this to that in order
to understand them.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,900
We can use this to our advantage
when designing by

15
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,330
creating visual hierarchy.

16
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,820
Establishing visual
relationships between elements

17
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,530
on the page is going to allow
your users to more quickly

18
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,630
process the information.

19
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:53,090
For example, let's say you've
got an informative site

20
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,610
promoting a new twist on a
traditional, every day item - 

21
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,200
dipping sauce.

22
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,190
You might have something
like this.

23
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,890
You could have a design that
uses large, handwritten type,

24
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,540
and life-like photographic
elements strewn about in an

25
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,360
apparently chaotic manner in
order to add visual intrigue

26
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,060
to a mundane item.

27
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,670
What's significant about this
site is that it uses

28
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,710
differences in size to draw the
eye naturally from large

29
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,170
elements down to the small
elements, which helps the user

30
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,990
more easily process
the information.

31
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,790
Take, for instance,
this paragraph.

32
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,880
The amount of text isn't really
all that much, but if

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,720
this is the first thing I see
when I come to your website,

34
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,970
I'm leaving.

35
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,060
There's no visual indicator
that allows me to quickly

36
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,610
assess what the rest of
the content is about.

37
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,900
In order to really understand
it, I have to read all of it,

38
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,040
which is more of a time
commitment than you can

39
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,670
realistically expect
from your users.

40
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,790
Let's look at the same block
of text, but establish some

41
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,710
visual relationships.

42
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:57,480
By taking the first phrase and
creating a headline out of it,

43
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,790
we've created some variance that
gives the user something

44
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,300
to latch onto.

45
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,400
Now, instead of reading the
entire paragraph, they can

46
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,820
simply read the headline and
understand what the rest of

47
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,500
the paragraph is about.

48
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,650
So if you remember from the
first video, we're working

49
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,080
towards creating
a style guide.

50
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,580
And as you can see here, the
style guide already has some

51
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,360
variances in size.

52
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,150
So how did we get there?

53
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,460
Where do we start when it comes
to making typographical

54
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,310
size decisions?

55
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,180
We start with body copy.

56
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,060
This is a little bit tricky to
navigate, because there is no

57
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,170
golden standard for what size
your body copy font should be.

58
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:42,970
For example, this well respected
creative journal

59
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:47,190
uses body copy at 16 pixels.

60
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,830
However, this well respected
designer uses 26 pixels for

61
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,570
his body copy.

62
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:59,240
Personally, I think huge type
is annoying, especially when

63
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,470
viewing on a browser that's not
the full vertical height

64
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,710
of the screen.

65
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,950
For this course, we're going to
be suggesting that you use

66
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:11,120
16 pixel body copy font,
although each case needs to be

67
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,340
weighed individually.

68
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,310
Different contexts, different
websites will call for

69
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,500
different font sizes.

70
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,660
Once we've established the body
copy size, everything

71
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,610
else is set relative to that.

72
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,530
The next decision you'll need
to make is the size of the

73
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,890
headline, which can be anywhere
from 200% to 300% of

74
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,150
the body copy.

75
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,460
Everything else can be set
relatively in between there.

76
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:38,400
The b-head is at 150% of
the body copy, and the

77
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,200
navigational text is the same
size as the body copy.

78
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,750
Your byline text should be
smaller than your body copy by

79
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,260
2 to 4 pixels, or about 75%.

80
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,030
Once you've got your type sizes
set, it's time to move

81
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,116
on to leading.

82
00:03:53,116 --> 00:03:56,310
Leading is the amount of space
between lines of text.

83
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,770
It's measured from baseline to
baseline, and as you can see

84
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,930
here, a baseline is the line
where the majority of the font

85
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,630
ends, with the exception of
characters like y, p, or g,

86
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,190
that have what is known
as a descender that

87
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,870
goes below the baseline.

88
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,200
Leading that is too large
negatively affects

89
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,290
readability, as the eye has to
move further between lines of

90
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:24,200
text, and can easily get lost.

91
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,460
On the other side, leading that
is too small can create a

92
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,500
cramped or claustrophobic feel
that rushes the reader, and

93
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,780
generally makes them
feel uncomfortable.

94
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,810
Remember, it's about visual
relationships.

95
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,520
Establishing a proper
relationship between the text

96
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,810
and the space around it is
going to increase user

97
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,380
engagement.

98
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:49,380
Good leading is around 120% to
150% of the body copy size.

99
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,670
Luckily for us, we don't
have to do the math.

100
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,880
By using the CSS property line-
height and setting it

101
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,150
relatively to 1.5 will ensure
that no matter what the font

102
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,600
size is, that the line height
will always be 150% of that.

103
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,440

104
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,160
Another visual hierarchy tool at
your disposal is using bold

105
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,200
or italic weights.

106
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,890
Using these different weights
can add emphasis and intrigue

107
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,090
to your design.

108
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,740
However, using too much bold
can muddy your hierarchy.

109
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,510
It's almost as if everything is
screaming at you at once.

110
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,910
Also, make sure your
bold or italics

111
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,550
compliment the natural value.

112
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,100
For instance, the eye naturally
expects the headline

113
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,600
to be bolder than the body copy,
so by using a thin font

114
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,530
for your headline and a bold
font for your body copy,

115
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,710
you're going to confuse
the user.

116
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,880
When using bold or italic
weights, stick to a less is

117
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,210
more approach that will really
enhance your hierarchy.

118
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,310

119
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,750
Now you can try your hand
at these concepts in the

120
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,000
challenges.

121
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,930
