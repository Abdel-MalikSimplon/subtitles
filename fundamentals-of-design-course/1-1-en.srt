00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:06,180
Learn to use fonts with
typography, a style guide

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,160
helps visual hierarchy.

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,160
With HSL build a color scheme,
and add a page layout to

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,590
complete the scene.

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,050
Combine these topics and
you will find the

8
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,536
Fundamentals of Design.

9
00:00:20,536 --> 00:00:24,910

10
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,890
Welcome to the Fundamentals
of Design.

11
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:27,860
My name is Tim Dikun.

12
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,100
And in this course, we're
going to be covering the

13
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:34,110
basics of typography, color,
and layout in web design.

14
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,160
Before we jump into typography,
we're going to

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,640
talk about one of the most basic
principles in design and

16
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,220
that's the idea that
content is king.

17
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,400
The designer's one essential
task is to interpret and

18
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,380
communicate the content.

19
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,510
And this means that the design
must ultimately reflect the

20
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,320
spirit of the content.

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,440
What do I mean by this?

22
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,860
Let's say that I'm designing a
website for a design studio

23
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,020
with a formal mission statement
targeting business

24
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,120
leaders looking to bring
their company out of

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,510
the analog-only world.

26
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,770
The design might look something
like this, where

27
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,520
we've got elegant, simple, and
large type that intentionally

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,630
mashes with irregular shapes
to reinforce their grasp on

29
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,330
the tension between old business
and new technology.

30
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,400
Well, let's say that you're
designing a website for a

31
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,620
playfully-themed film festival
for horror entertainment

32
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,760
enthusiasts supporting local
business and the common good.

33
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,800
You might end up with
something like this.

34
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,340
Where you've got decorative
sketch type at varying sizes

35
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,930
and angles that creates a
haunted dynamic without being

36
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,400
overly dark or graphic so
as to remain inviting.

37
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,000
So, how does content influence
design, and what should you be

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,860
looking for as you're
preparing?

39
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,350
There are three main attributes
of content that

40
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,990
influence the design.

41
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,240
The first one is the
target audience.

42
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,130
What is their age, race,
gender, cultural niche?

43
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,730
Next, you've got the tone.

44
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,170
Is it casual or formal?

45
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,030
And lastly, you've
got purpose.

46
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,590
Is it informational or
conversion driven?

47
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,630
And only after you address
these questions about the

48
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,005
content are you ready
to begin designing.

49
00:02:14,005 --> 00:02:16,920

50
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,920
So, let's jump into typography.

51
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,030
We are going to be putting
together what is known as a

52
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,330
style guide.

53
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,870
And a style guide is a reference
document with

54
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,440
multiple instances of typography
that you'll be

55
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,930
using throughout your website
or application.

56
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,250
And this is what your style
guide might look like if you

57
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,560
were designing a website that
has a lot of news articles or

58
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,870
even a blog.

59
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,250
You'd have your headline text,
your B-head or sub-head text,

60
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,690
your navigation text,
your body copy,

61
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,700
and your byline text.

62
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,930
Putting these together
beforehand is going to help

63
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,960
you avoid inconsistency
throughout your application

64
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,860
and create an overall better
design and better user

65
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,890
experience.

66
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,110
The first thing you need to know
about typography is that

67
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,370
some fonts are just plain awful,
and that good fonts are

68
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,390
often taken for granted with
the thousands of digitally

69
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,210
available free fonts.

70
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,950
So don't just choose a font that
you think looks cool for

71
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,040
your website.

72
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,290
Invest the time to get to know
the type faces and choose one

73
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,530
that really suits your
content well.

74
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,480
Typography is both verbal
and visual.

75
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,690
The reader first surveys the
overall graphical patterns of

76
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,790
the page, and then they parse
the language and read.

77
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,400
This means that different styles
of type, different

78
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,370
classifications of type, create
different moods that will

79
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,110
either serve your content
well or not.

80
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,920
So you must take the time to
know the different styles and

81
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,290
classes of type and choose one
that's really going to serve

82
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,430
your content well.

83
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,450
Let's look first the
classification of

84
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,520
type known as serif.

85
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,070
In a serif is a small
line tailing from

86
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,970
the edges of letters.

87
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,710
And any font that contains these
small lines is known as

88
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,140
a serif font.

89
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,610
And within the serif
classification, there are many

90
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,440
different styles of type.

91
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,120
Let's look at some
of those now.

92
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,400
The first one is humanist.

93
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,050
And a humanist font emulates
classical calligraphy and

94
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,310
contains some contrast in the
stroke that creates a very

95
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:20,170
classic and traditional feel
that's great for journalism or

96
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,450
historical applications.

97
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,860
A transitional serif has a much
sharper serif than the

98
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,805
humanist and has much more
contrast between the thick and

99
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:33,180
the thin strokes
of the letters.

100
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,810
That creates a very strong,
stylish, and dynamic feel

101
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,600
that's great for traditional
academia and legal

102
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,480
applications.

103
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,360
The modern serif has a very
thin, horizontal serif and

104
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,870
very high contrast between the
thick and the thin strokes.

105
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,040
That creates a very structured,
clear, and elegant

106
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,090
feel that's great for arts
and culture applications.

107
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,380
The last style of serif fonts
is Egyptian, also

108
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,100
know as slab serif.

109
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,840
And they're known for having
heavy, boxy serifs and almost

110
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,740
no contrast in the stroke.

111
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,110
That creates an authoritative,
yet friendly feel that's great

112
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,970
for marketing and promotional
applications.

113
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:18,980
The next classification
of type is sans-serif.

114
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,240
Sans is the French
word for without.

115
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,710
And so it stands to reason that
any font that is without

116
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,850
a serif is known as
a sans-serif.

117
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,870
And like the serif font, within
this classification

118
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,620
there are multiple
different styles.

119
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,850
The first one is humanist
sans serif.

120
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,410
And like the humanist serif font
it emulates calligraphy

121
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,640
and has minimal contrast
in the strokes.

122
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,500
And this creates a tension
between the perfect and the

123
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,200
imperfect that's great for
government or educational

124
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,740
applications.

125
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,590
The transitional sans serif
has very upright, uniform

126
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:01,040
characters and strong strokes
that creates an unassuming and

127
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,680
modern feel that's great for
technology and transportation

128
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,000
applications.

129
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,920
And finally, there's the
geometric sans serif, where

130
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,460
geometric shapes form the
backbones of the letters.

131
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,180
This creates a very strict
objective and universal feel

132
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,340
that's great for a science or
architecture application.

133
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,480
The final classification of type
that we're going to talk

134
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,070
about is script.

135
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,210
And script fonts mimic
handwriting or calligraphy.

136
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,520
They're really great for adding
a human element to your

137
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,890
website, but they're not
so great for body copy.

138
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:37,290
As you can see, it's quite
difficult to read.

139
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,430
Something you should know is
that comic sans is technically

140
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,970
a script font, not a sans serif
font, and should not be used

141
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:48,650
for body copy or really
anywhere ever.

142
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,610
When selecting typefaces for
your application, feel free to

143
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,080
mix and mingle.

144
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,510
Because while one type face is
often enough, adding another

145
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,270
can create quite the
beautiful effect.

146
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,840
Using a serif for the headline
and the intro paragraph on

147
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,430
this article and a sans serif
for the body copy is perhaps

148
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,600
the simplest and most

149
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,720
effective way to mix typefaces.

150
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,040
When mixing typefaces, there
are a couple of things that

151
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,560
you need to keep in mind.

152
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,010
And the first one is don't
choose two fonts

153
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,490
from the same style.

154
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,320
Like these:

155
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,160
We've got Epic, which is a
humanist serif, and Garamond,

156
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,480
which is also a humanist serif,
and they're are two

157
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,340
similar to one another
to really look good.

158
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:34,100
Like wearing a red shirt with
an orange tie, they clash.

159
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,660
Furthermore, don't choose two
fonts from the same class.

160
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,650
Unless you really know your
typefaces, it's very difficult

161
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,640
to choose two serifs or two
sans fonts that really

162
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,470
complement each other well.

163
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,680
Like here we've got epic, which
is again a humanist

164
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,520
serif, and agora, which
is a slab serif.

165
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,890
They don't combine well.

166
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:01,730
When mixing classes, find a
similar trait using fonts that

167
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:05,290
share one thing in common but
are otherwise different, like

168
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:09,150
a humanist serif and a humanist
sans, can create

169
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,330
quite the beautiful pairing.

170
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:14,870
And that trait can even be
largely abstract. Like these

171
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,450
two fonts Perpetua, which is a
transitional serif, and Gill

172
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,560
Sans, which is a humanist
sans, were both

173
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,630
designed by Eric Gill.

174
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:27,840
Similarities in chronology,
visual details, or even

175
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,970
typeface designer between
otherwise different fonts can

176
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,370
create great pairings.

177
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,510
All in all, you should strive
for contrast over harmony.

178
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,900
A good rule of thumb to follow
when mixing typefaces is keep

179
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,820
it the same or change
it a lot.

180
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:48,100
Look for emphatic differences
rather than mushy transitions.

181
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,160
And here's an example of a
content site that uses a

182
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,410
geometric sans sparingly as
headline and pull quote text

183
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,780
alongside a transitional serif
body copy font that creates a

184
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,600
really great pairing.

185
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,020
Or here, you've got a script
font next to a geometric sans,

186
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,835
which is about as much contrast
as you can get.

187
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:12,060
The variance in the handwriting
versus the

188
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,570
objectivity of the shapes
creates quite

189
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,000
the stunning effect.

190
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,840
But don't feel obligated
to pick two

191
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,380
fonts for your project.

192
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,090
A single typeface
is often enough.

193
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:25,030
And honestly, for the beginner
this is ideal.

194
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,840
Really practice and hone your
craft using the different

195
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,950
weights of just one font family
before moving on and

196
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,620
trying to incorporate
many others.

197
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,160
Here's an example of this:

198
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,550
The entire code school website
is designed using different

199
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,760
weights of just one sans
serif font family.

200
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,420
One final note about type on
the web before we conclude

201
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,920
this first video.

202
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,950
Make sure that you're using
web-licensed fonts.

203
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,770
Just because you have a font
on your computer, does not

204
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:55,380
mean that it's legal to put
it on the internet.

205
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,290
Now it's time for you to apply
some of these principles and

206
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,780
try your hand at mixing
typefaces.

207
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,778
