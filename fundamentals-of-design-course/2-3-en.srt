1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,690
Now that we've learned about
color and color schemes, it's

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,130
time to combine that with
our knowledge of type.

4
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,240
The most important thing
to keep in mind is that

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,610
typography must have a high
degree of contrast between it

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,470
and its background.

7
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,080
Contrast is defined as the
difference in colors.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,470
It can be a small difference
or a large difference, and

9
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,740
there could be differences
in just a hue,

10
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,980
saturation, or lightness.

11
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,950
A contrast of hue is when
two colors have the same

12
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,900
saturation and lightness,
but differ in

13
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,530
hue, as you see here.

14
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,260

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,230
A contrast of saturation is
when the hue and lightness

16
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,350
remain constant, but the
saturation changes from one

17
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,540
color to the next.

18
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,040
And a contrast of lightness
is when the hue and the

19
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,710
saturation remain constant, but
the lightness changes from

20
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,490
one color to the next.

21
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,330
The biggest contrast of them
all, black and white, can be

22
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,130
considered a contrast
of lightness.

23
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,010
Most contrasts are
multi-faceted.

24
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,870
It's very common to combine
contrasts of hue, saturation,

25
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,620
and lightness.

26
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,360
This contrast of hue for font
color and background creates a

27
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,070
contrast that is too low
to really read well.

28
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,770
However, if we make it a
contrast of both hue and

29
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:21,440
lightness, it becomes
much easier to read.

30
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,940
Furthermore, if we make it a
contrast of all three, hue,

31
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,600
saturation, and lightness, it
gets even easier to read.

32
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,340

33
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,930
There are standards for how much
contrast there needs to

34
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,730
be between type and its
background color.

35
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,570
It's called the WCAG, or Web
Content Accessibility

36
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,540
Guidelines.

37
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,320
These standards are put in place
to make sure that all

38
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,340
websites are legible
to all users.

39
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,620
Very simple, high contrast
colors, such as black and

40
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,810
white are the best.

41
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,200
Colors that are the same hue
but have a very high

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,140
saturation and lightness
contrast are a close second.

43
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,960
Some colors are intrinsically
difficult for humans to

44
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,130
distinguish, such as red and
green and blue and orange.

45
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,710
Especially for color blind
individuals, they're going to

46
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,220
have a very tough time
reading this.

47
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,090
Different colors have different
natural values.

48
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,890
For instance, yellow is a
naturally light color, while

49
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,830
blue is a naturally
dark color.

50
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,500
So creating contrast in which
the yellow is darker than the

51
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,750
blue creates a very awkward
experience.

52
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,840
If we fix the lightness to
correspond with the natural

53
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,730
values, making the yellow light
and the blue dark, the

54
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,020
type becomes much
more legible.

55
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,790
Some colors are considered
warm, and some

56
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,010
are considered cold.

57
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:49,050
The warm side of the color
spectrum is the red, orange,

58
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,280
and yellow side.

59
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,170
And the cool side is the green,
blue, and purple side.

60
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,410
Using contrasts of warm and
cool colors alone does not

61
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,880
create a legible contrast.

62
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,160
However, warm and cool colors
can be used to create depth,

63
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,300
as warm colors appear closer to
the screen or to the user

64
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,980
than cool colors do.

65
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,390
So use cool colors in the
background and warm colors in

66
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,740
the foreground.

67
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,580
The colors you use in your style
guide should reinforce

68
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,070
the visual hierarchy.

69
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,050
For instance, the backgrounds on
the Code School website get

70
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,520
progressively darker as you
scroll, which anchors the page

71
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,590
and create a more stable
viewing experience.

72
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,060
When trying to put type on an
image, avoid the use of drop

73
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,500
shadows and strokes, as
they can appear tacky.

74
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,390
Instead, treat the image
behind the text to

75
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,850
make it stand out.

76
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,790
Overlaying a pattern and
darkening the image can really

77
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,360
help the text pop.

78
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,750
When considering putting
type in an image, stop,

79
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,330
and don't do it.

80
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,670
Legitimate copy does not belong
in an image, unless

81
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,750
it's a hilarious picture of
a kitty cat, like this one

82
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,250
contemplating a serious life
decision as to whether or not

83
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,590
to buy a boat.

84
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,550
Taking a look at the Code
School's color scheme, you can

85
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,710
see that we use both
complimentary and analogous

86
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:14,040
colors, as well as including
high contrast text and

87
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,290
background colors.

88
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,610

89
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,700
Now, it's time to put your
knowledge of color and

90
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,950
typography to the test.

91
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,831
