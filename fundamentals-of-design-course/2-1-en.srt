00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,850
These next few videos, we're
going to be going over color

12
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,810
and how to incorporate them
into your website or app.

13
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,470
Let's start with some
basic color theory.

14
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,180
There are two types of color:

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,300
color you can touch, like the
skin of an apple, and then

16
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,100
there's color you can't touch,
like the projected light

17
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,880
coming from a monitor.

18
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,280
Color you can touch is called
subtractive color, and color

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,530
you can't touch is called
additive color.

20
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,760
Subtractive color is controlled
using the CMYK

21
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,720
color space.

22
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,390
You may have noticed that your
printer at home has four basic

23
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,629
ink cartridges -

24
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:09,180
cyan, magenta, yellow,
and black.

25
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:15,440
And in theory, all of these
colors mixed create black.

26
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,060
Additive color is controlled
using the RGB color spectrum,

27
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,040
which stands for red,
green, and blue.

28
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,420
And in theory, all colors
mix to yield white.

29
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,070
Because we're dealing primarily
with web design,

30
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,140
we're going to be dealing with
the RGB color space.

31
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,790
Humans don't process color
in the terms of

32
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,130
red, green, and blue.

33
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,350
We actually process things in
the terms of HSL, which stands

34
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,470
for hue, saturation,
and lightness.

35
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,660
Hue is best visualized
on a color wheel.

36
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,090
You start at zero degrees, which
is red, and as you move

37
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,600
around the circle, you get
to different colors.

38
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,170
Each degree correlates
to a different color.

39
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:02,590
120 degrees is green, and 240
degrees is blue, perfectly

40
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,770
encapsulating the entire
RGB color space.

41
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,979
The S stands for saturation,
which is the difference

42
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,700
between a color and gray.

43
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,570
A hue at 100% saturation is the
most vibrant forum that

44
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,690
color, where at 0% is gray.

45
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,980
And lightness is the amount
of light in a color.

46
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:29,560
A hue at 100% lightness
is white and at 0%

47
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,670
lightness is black.

48
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:36,920
And 50% lightness is the most
vibrant form of that hue.

49
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,350
For example, let's say we've got
a color where the hue is

50
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,930
zero degrees, the saturation
is 100%, and the

51
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,860
lightness is 50%.

52
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,200
This is the most pure form of
red that we can get in HSL

53
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,980
color space.

54
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,440
But what happens if we increase
the lightness to 75%?

55
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,920
We actually get a color that
has more white in it, more

56
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,870
light in it, and so therefore
is more of a pink color.

57
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,900
In the same way, if we were to
decrease the lightness, we're

58
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,890
adding more black into that
color, and we're actually

59
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,560
getting a much darker red.

60
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,570
So now if we bring the lightness
back up to its

61
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,320
original 50% and instead of
messing with the lightness, we

62
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,860
drop the saturation down to 25%,
we get a very muted or

63
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,910
pastel red color.

64
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,250
And from there, if I were to
completely reverse the hue to

65
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:36,450
be 180 degrees, we actually get
a muted teal-ish color.

66
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,080
The HSL color space can be
visualized as a three

67
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,960
dimensional cylinder.

68
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,710
Let's walk through each
one of the dimensions.

69
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,640
The first one is hue.

70
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,320
As we talked about earlier, as
you move around the circle,

71
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,210
the hue changes.

72
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,770
Each degree is a different
color.

73
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,900
The second one is saturation.

74
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,560
If you visualize it as starting
in the middle and the

75
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,320
core of the cylinder and moving
towards the outsides,

76
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,650
the saturation increases
or decreases.

77
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,240
And the third dimension is
lightness, which starts at the

78
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,750
bottom of the cylinder and moves
up to the top, being

79
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,500
black at the bottom and
white at the top.

80
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,170
It's very inconvenient to view
this three dimensional

81
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:21,279
color space on a 2D monitor,
so usually a hue saturation

82
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,510
wheel and a brightness slider
does the trick.

83
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,520
Let's look at these in action.

84
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,810
For example, if I were to select
a color that has 240

85
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,980
degrees in hue and 100% for the

86
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,160
saturation, it would be here.

87
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,800
And if I were to set the
lightness at 50%, I get this

88
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,795
color, which is the purest
form of blue in

89
00:04:43,795 --> 00:04:45,950
the RGB color space.

90
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:50,560
If I were to decrease the
saturation, the hue saturation

91
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,440
selector would move in towards
the middle of the circle.

92
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,010
And leaving the lightness slider
at 50% creates a more

93
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,220
muted blue.

94
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,310
Now, if I leave the hue and
saturation where it was at and

95
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,180
increase the lightness slider,
I'm adding more white into the

96
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:13,100
color, and I actually get
a very pastel purple.

97
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,220
You may have noticed that in
this course, we're using the

98
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,030
HSL color space, where L
stands for lightness.

99
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,660
If you were to open up Photoshop
or any other

100
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,090
application that has a color
picker, you would probably see

101
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:29,560
the HSB color space, the
B being brightness.

102
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,430
So what's the difference?

103
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:36,540
The difference is that with
lightness at 100%,

104
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,100
the color is white.

105
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,330
But with the brightness at 100%,
the color is simply the

106
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,680
most vibrant form of that hue.

107
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,870

108
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,610
It's time for you to try your
hand at mixing colors in these

109
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,860
different color spaces.

110
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,113
