00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,700
Learn to use fonts
with typography.

4
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,160
A style guide helps
visual hierarchy.

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,320
With HSL, build a
color scheme.

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,600
And add a page layout to
complete the scene.

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,050
Combine these topics, and
you will find the

8
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,560
fundamentals of design.

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,460

10
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,600
You're watching part
three of the

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,290
Fundamentals of Design course.

12
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,060
In the next few videos, we're
going to be walking through

13
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,509
different layout concepts.

14
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:36,760
Layout is fundamentally an
exercise in visual hierarchy.

15
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,970
Yet again, you arrange the
elements on the page to direct

16
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,420
and engage the user's eye.

17
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,660
Let's look at some of the basic
elements of a website

18
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,160
and how they might be laid
out on the page.

19
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,720
Because English is read from
left to right and top to

20
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,990
bottom, users generally start in
the upper left hand corner

21
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,320
of the page and move
out from there.

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,270
So a good place to start is by
placing your logo or your

23
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,860
brand in the upper
left hand corner.

24
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,860
It's important to note that a
brand is not just a logo, and

25
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,460
that every pixel on the page
should reinforce your brand.

26
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,570
But including a logo is
a great first step.

27
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,220
Once you've placed your logo
on the page, it's time to

28
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,120
place your navigation.

29
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,440
Because navigation varies so
much from site to site, there

30
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,080
are no real set guidelines
on how to place it.

31
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,280
It's all about making something
complex as simple

32
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,990
and consistent as possible.

33
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,550
Navigations can be horizontal
or vertical.

34
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:42,950
For instance, horizontal is
ideal for navigations with

35
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,200
only a few items.

36
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,790

37
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:51,800
However, vertical works well,
in a similar fashion.

38
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,540
Vertical really excels when
you've got a lot of nested

39
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,750
pages, though if you drop your
horizontal navigation below

40
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:05,770
the logo, a tiered system with
lots of items works as well.

41
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:09,650
Both layouts are great for drop
downs or fly outs, such

42
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:13,650
as Amazon's vertical fly out
navigation that works really

43
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:21,120
well and ESPN's great horizontal
drop down menu.

44
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,100
It's important to note that
vertical navigation isn't

45
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,600
really used all that much.

46
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,640
And while it does work, make
sure you've got a really good

47
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,230
reason to use it.

48
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,970
Once you've got your logo and
your navigation placed, it's

49
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,970
time to place your
main content.

50
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,840
And the main content can be
placed under a horizontal nav

51
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,610
or next to a vertical nav.

52
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,730
Whatever you do, make sure that
the content within the

53
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:51,230
main content container
reinforces the hierarchy.

54
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,980
So, what exactly does
that mean?

55
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,600
The eye will follow directional
cues of elements

56
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,010
on the page.

57
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,350
So make sure that all those
directional cues are pointing

58
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,660
to your content.

59
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,090
For instance, you can see here
this businessman on this photo

60
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,780
is looking away from
the main content.

61
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,470
So the user's eye is going to
start in the upper left hand

62
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,530
corner, and as it moves down,
it's going to notice the

63
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,730
businessman and where he's
looking and follow it off the

64
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,960
page and not engaging
with your content.

65
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,230
To improve upon this, if the
businessman was looking at the

66
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,870
content, you'd start in the
upper left hand corner and

67
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,490
move down, notice where he's
looking, and be encouraged to

68
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,210
engage with the rest of
the content more.

69
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,970
We can make this even better
by making the content first

70
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,410
and the directional cues
reinforce that content.

71
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,850
So here we start with the logo,
and as our eye moves, we

72
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,960
directly engage with
the content.

73
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,390
And if, by chance, our eye was
to bounce far to the right,

74
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,030
the directional cues
of that image lead

75
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,560
us back to the content.

76
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,640
Secondary content should be
smaller and relegated to the

77
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,060
side, though it can also be
broken up into chunks and

78
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,580
placed underneath the
main content.

79
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,470
And finally, the footer anchors
the page and provides

80
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,360
quick hit information that
your user might need

81
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,510
quick access to.

82
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,240
And no matter what the layout
is, the footer should always

83
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,719
span the entire width
of the page.

84
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:19,339

85
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,550
Alright, now it's time for you to start
putting together some layouts.

86
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:25,516
