1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,090

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,100
Now that we've learned the
fundamentals of color theory,

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,590
we need to start building
a color scheme.

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,320
And a color scheme is four or
five colors built into your

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,230
style guide.

6
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,870
These colors will be applied
to different elements

7
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,770
throughout your application,
such as buttons, text color,

8
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,640
or backgrounds.

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,260
The first decision you have to
make when creating a color

10
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,580
scheme is to choose
a base color.

11
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,610
And the base color is the
foundational color from which

12
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,530
the rest of the color scheme
will be built out.

13
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,610
When selecting a base color,
you have to realize that

14
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,620
different colors create
different moods.

15
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,860
And this plays itself out
in the world around

16
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,780
us on a daily basis.

17
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,640
Have you ever seen
this before?

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,540
A doctor's office painted red.

19
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,680
I'd venture to say you
probably haven't.

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,910
And that's because red is
the color of passion or

21
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,260
excitement, not the cool,
calming colors that you'd

22
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,360
expect from a doctor's office.

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,360
Or how about this?

24
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,580
A science fiction movie poster
that uses hot pink typography.

25
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,879
It's much more suited for
the My Little Pony

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,470
movie than Star Trek.

27
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,970
So, exactly what moods does
each color create?

28
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,520
Let's walk through them.

29
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,770
Red is the color of heat,
passion, and excitement.

30
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,640
And it easily grabs attention
and evokes a

31
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,430
certain speed and energy.

32
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,420
Orange is the color of
warmth and vitality.

33
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,510
And it is associated with
reliability and playfulness.

34
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:33,120
Yellow is the color of optimism
or creativity and

35
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,490
represents sunshine, cheer,
and happiness.

36
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:41,590
Green is the color of serenity
or health and connotes growth,

37
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,400
nature, and freshness.

38
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,450
Blue is the color of security,
truth, and stability and

39
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:54,420
implies loyalty, reliability,
and open communication.

40
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,140
Purple is the color of
spirituality, intelligence,

41
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,440
and wealth and can also mean
royal, sentimental, creative,

42
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,920
and sophisticated.

43
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,780
Pink is the color of youthful
intensity and conveys energy,

44
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,740
fun, and excitement.

45
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,420
And brown is the color of
durability or class, and

46
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,360
represents age, stability,
and relaxation.

47
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,370
Black is a color of power or
drama, and it's serious, bold,

48
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,490
and strong.

49
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,970
And white is the color of
simplicity and cleanliness.

50
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,220
And its message is youthful,
mild, and pure.

51
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,720
You must always remember to
keep culture in mind when

52
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,230
choosing a base color.

53
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,670
For instance, red in Western
societies, as we've talked

54
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,180
about, conveys an intensity
or energy.

55
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,990
But in China, it's the color of
good luck, whereas in South

56
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,260
Africa, it's the color
of mourning.

57
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:56,630
And in Russian contexts, it's
associated with communism.

58
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,270
Once you've selected a base
color, it's time to build out

59
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,140
the rest of your color scheme.

60
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,050
And there are multiple different
methods you can use

61
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,050
to determine what that color
scheme will look like.

62
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,350
Let's dive into a
couple of those.

63
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:13,170
A monochromatic color scheme is
a color scheme in which all

64
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,290
of the colors have the same
hue, and they vary in

65
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,410
saturation and lightness.

66
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,550
To use this, you'd start with
your base color, which you see

67
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:26,110
here in the middle, and create
four different colors, keeping

68
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,990
the hue constant and only
changing the saturation and

69
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,450
brightness.

70
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,210
Monochromatic color schemes are
the easiest to create and

71
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,320
work very well together.

72
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,390
But they often lack
the versatility

73
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,810
of other color schemes.

74
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,240
The next color scheme
that we're going

75
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,700
to look at is analogous.

76
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,650
An analogous color scheme,
similar to the monochromatic

77
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,330
color scheme, has colors
that vary in

78
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,150
saturation and lightness.

79
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,240
However, instead of the hue
remaining constant, the hue

80
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,450
both increases and decreases,
showing the colors adjacent to

81
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,740
it on the color wheel.

82
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,460
A complementary color scheme
also varies in saturation and

83
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,540
lightness, but differs in that
it has colors of the same hue

84
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,060
to the base color and colors
of the opposite hue to the

85
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,470
base color on the color wheel.

86
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,459
To find the colors opposite
hue, visualize it

87
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,230
on the color wheel.

88
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:24,960
Look to the exact opposite, or
180 degrees away from that

89
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,030
color, and you'll find
the opposite.

90
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,820
These are just three of the
methods that you can use when

91
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,550
putting together
a color scheme.

92
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,790
There are so many more.

93
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,700
Take the time to research and
learn about all of the

94
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,480
different color schemes
available.

95
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,240
Know that while a color scheme
can be objectively correct, it

96
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,930
can still be ugly.

97
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,480
For instance, this complementary
color scheme

98
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,200
uses very strange purples and
greens that would not actually

99
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,060
look good together
on a website.

100
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,700
When implementing color schemes,
know that they don't

101
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,330
need to be perfect.

102
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,580
You can use these methods,
such as complementary or

103
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:06,530
analogous, as a base and tweak
as needed to fit your project.

104
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,600
Now it's time for you to try
creating color schemes.

105
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,980
