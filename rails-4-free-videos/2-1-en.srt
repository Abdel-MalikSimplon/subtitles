00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,329


2
00:00:02,329 --> 00:00:04,327
I'm Carlos Souza, and
you're watching

3
00:00:04,327 --> 00:00:06,377
Rails 4: Zombie Outlaws.

4
00:00:06,377 --> 00:00:09,037
In this level, we're going to be
talking about active record

5
00:00:09,037 --> 00:00:12,407
and active model.

6
00:00:12,407 --> 00:00:15,157
So back in previous versions
of Rails, you might have

7
00:00:15,157 --> 00:00:19,477
gotten used to writing the old
style finders, say, using

8
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:23,577
Post.find and then specifying
that you want to find all and

9
00:00:23,577 --> 00:00:25,947
then passing a hash with
the conditions.

10
00:00:25,947 --> 00:00:29,197
These old style finders are now
deprecating and you should

11
00:00:29,197 --> 00:00:32,477
just use the active relation
API instead.

12
00:00:32,477 --> 00:00:36,967
Rewriting that to Post.where
author is admin.

13
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:39,857
If you really need to use the
old style finders, then you

14
00:00:39,857 --> 00:00:42,667
can still use them through the
activerecord-deprecated_finders

15
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:43,917
gem.

16
00:00:43,917 --> 00:00:46,167


17
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:49,107
Dynamic finders that return
collections are also

18
00:00:49,107 --> 00:00:50,347
deprecated.

19
00:00:50,347 --> 00:00:53,207
In this example, we're using the
magic finder

20
00:00:53,207 --> 00:00:55,707
find_all_by_title and passing a
single argument.

21
00:00:56,447 --> 00:00:59,547
Instead, we should just use
the active relation API

22
00:00:59,547 --> 00:01:02,017
post.where title equals Rails.

23
00:01:02,017 --> 00:01:05,967
The same thing for
find_last_by_author in this case.

24
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:09,677
You should just use the active
relation query specifying the

25
00:01:09,677 --> 00:01:10,927
last element.

26
00:01:10,927 --> 00:01:14,487


27
00:01:14,487 --> 00:01:17,317
Dynamic finders that take a
single argument are not

28
00:01:17,317 --> 00:01:18,607
deprecated.

29
00:01:18,607 --> 00:01:23,407
In this example, find_by_title
will work fine in Rails 4.

30
00:01:23,407 --> 00:01:26,577
However, there's a new way to
do this query using the new

31
00:01:26,577 --> 00:01:30,347
find_by method that takes a hash
as an argument, which is

32
00:01:30,347 --> 00:01:32,877
now the preferred
way to do this.

33
00:01:32,877 --> 00:01:36,527
Dynamic find_by finders that
take a conditions hash are now

34
00:01:36,527 --> 00:01:37,967
deprecated.

35
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:41,837
In this example, using the
find_by_title passing the hash

36
00:01:41,837 --> 00:01:45,297
as the second argument is not
supported in Rails 4.

37
00:01:45,297 --> 00:01:48,177
And again, you should use the
find_by method passing the

38
00:01:48,177 --> 00:01:49,437
single hash as an argument.

39
00:01:49,437 --> 00:01:52,637


40
00:01:52,637 --> 00:01:55,237
Another reason why you should
prefer the find_by method is

41
00:01:55,237 --> 00:01:58,047
because it allows dynamic
input more easily.

42
00:01:58,047 --> 00:02:01,047
In this case, we could get the
post params back from some

43
00:02:01,047 --> 00:02:05,587
other method and pass it down
to the find_by method.

44
00:02:05,587 --> 00:02:07,707
And if you look at the
implementation of the find by

45
00:02:07,707 --> 00:02:11,297
method, you'll notice that
find by is only a wrapper

46
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:15,597
around the where method that
returns the first occurrence.

47
00:02:15,597 --> 00:02:18,317
So find by takes pretty
much the same

48
00:02:18,317 --> 00:02:19,897
arguments that where does.

49
00:02:19,897 --> 00:02:23,607


50
00:02:23,607 --> 00:02:27,027
Lastly, dynamic finders that
create new records are also

51
00:02:27,027 --> 00:02:27,977
deprecated.

52
00:02:27,977 --> 00:02:31,877
In this example, find_or_
initialize_by_title or

53
00:02:31,877 --> 00:02:35,347
find_or_create_by_title were both
deprecated in favor of the new

54
00:02:35,347 --> 00:02:39,767
find_or_initialize_by and
find_or_create_by methods that

55
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:41,787
both take a hash
as an argument.

56
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:49,397


57
00:02:49,397 --> 00:02:51,647
There's yet another alternative
to this method

58
00:02:51,647 --> 00:02:55,287
introducing Rails 3, however,
there's a couple of gotchas

59
00:02:55,287 --> 00:02:56,307
with this alternative.

60
00:02:56,307 --> 00:02:58,447
Let's take a look
at an example.

61
00:02:58,447 --> 00:03:01,157
Here, we're calling
first or create on

62
00:03:01,157 --> 00:03:02,707
the return of a query.

63
00:03:02,707 --> 00:03:05,637
What's going to happen here is
that if there's no existing

64
00:03:05,637 --> 00:03:08,307
post with the title of
Rails 4, then it'll

65
00:03:08,307 --> 00:03:09,857
create a new post.

66
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,767
However, if you happen to have
any call backs defined for

67
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:17,647
create, say, after you create,
any query that runs on that

68
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:21,397
same model will run within
the context of the scope.

69
00:03:21,397 --> 00:03:23,827
In this case, we're querying
for all posts

70
00:03:23,827 --> 00:03:25,657
where author is admin.

71
00:03:25,657 --> 00:03:29,147
However, this query is going to
run within the context of

72
00:03:29,147 --> 00:03:32,057
the initial query so it's
actually going to select all

73
00:03:32,057 --> 00:03:36,447
posts where author equals admin
and title equals Rails

74
00:03:36,447 --> 00:03:38,537
4, which is kind of an
unexpected behavior.

75
00:03:38,537 --> 00:03:41,087


76
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:44,177
So this is another reason why
should prefer the new method

77
00:03:44,177 --> 00:03:46,197
find or create by.

78
00:03:46,197 --> 00:03:49,757
In this method, if there's no
existing post with the title

79
00:03:49,757 --> 00:03:52,597
for Rails 4, then it's simply
going to create a new post

80
00:03:52,597 --> 00:03:56,687
with the title for Rails 4 and
it does not affect scoping of

81
00:03:56,687 --> 00:03:58,937
queries that run within
the callback.

82
00:03:58,937 --> 00:04:02,247
And as you can see here, the
query insider after create

83
00:04:02,247 --> 00:04:05,327
method is going to simply look
for all posts where author

84
00:04:05,327 --> 00:04:06,577
equals admin.

85
00:04:06,577 --> 00:04:08,977


86
00:04:08,977 --> 00:04:11,547
We also had the update attribute
method which would

87
00:04:11,547 --> 00:04:15,037
take two arguments and in Rails
3, we had the addition

88
00:04:15,037 --> 00:04:17,137
of update column method
that would do

89
00:04:17,137 --> 00:04:18,567
basically the same thing.

90
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:20,847
The basic difference between
these is that these on the

91
00:04:20,847 --> 00:04:23,897
right here, they skip validation
all together.

92
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:26,887
Rails 4 adds a new alternative
to the update attributes

93
00:04:26,887 --> 00:04:30,347
method simply called update,
which behaves the same way and

94
00:04:30,347 --> 00:04:34,397
is not the preferred way to
update attributes for a model.

95
00:04:34,397 --> 00:04:36,847
And for these guys on the
right, we have an update

96
00:04:36,847 --> 00:04:40,427
columns method which takes a
hash as an argument and simply

97
00:04:40,427 --> 00:04:42,987
builds a SQL statement
and executes it

98
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:44,377
straight into the database.

99
00:04:44,377 --> 00:04:47,232
Again, skipping all the
validations for that model.

100
00:04:47,232 --> 00:04:50,027


101
00:04:50,027 --> 00:04:53,297
So back in Rails 3, you might
have used the scoped method

102
00:04:53,297 --> 00:04:56,607
that basically allows you to
dynamically build queries

103
00:04:56,607 --> 00:04:58,587
depending on certain
conditions.

104
00:04:58,587 --> 00:05:01,497
In this example here for an
index action on a controller,

105
00:05:01,497 --> 00:05:05,197
we're calling tweet.scoped which
does not run the query

106
00:05:05,197 --> 00:05:07,867
and it returns an active
relation object.

107
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:10,147
And based on certain
conditions, we

108
00:05:10,147 --> 00:05:11,647
can call other methods.

109
00:05:11,647 --> 00:05:16,557
In this case, tweets.recent in
case we have a params recent.

110
00:05:16,557 --> 00:05:20,297
Rails 4 deprecates scoped and we
should now just simply use

111
00:05:20,297 --> 00:05:24,067
the all method which does not
run the query right away and

112
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:27,417
returns a relation object that
we can call other methods on.

113
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:30,687
So in this example, what we get
back from tweet.all it's a

114
00:05:30,687 --> 00:05:33,497
chainable method that, depending
on the conditions,

115
00:05:33,497 --> 00:05:34,827
we can call other methods on.
