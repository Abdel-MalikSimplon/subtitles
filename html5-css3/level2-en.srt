1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,253
You're watching 3 For 5.

3
00:00:02,253 --> 00:00:03,670
I'm Jason VanLue.

4
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,020
And this Level 2.

5
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:10,388

6
00:00:10,388 --> 00:00:31,998
[MUSIC PLAYING]

7
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:35,110
So it doesn't matter if you're
a designer or a developer.

8
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,840
At the end of the day, our jobs
are basically the same.

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,680
We want to craft rich, usable
websites and web applications

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,830
with an awesome user
experience.

11
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,900
So we're going to look at
some styles in CSS3.

12
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,610
Now, just like HTML5, this
isn't an exhaustive list.

13
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,360
But it's rather a list of some
the more commonly used

14
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,840
properties.

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,730
So we're going to start
with border-radius.

16
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,640
Now, border-radius rounds the
cornders of an element with a

17
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,450
defined radius value.

18
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,960
Now, this is an awesome
property.

19
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,450
Because if you remember before,
in order to get

20
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,650
rounded corners on an image or
a button, you would have had

21
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,650
to do a variety of hacks or
save out transparent PNGs.

22
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,610
Now, we can let CSS do
the work for us.

23
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,840
So if we had a rectangular
button, now we can add rounded

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,870
corners, simply by using the
border-radius property.

25
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,220
So in this case, we have a
border-radius of 10 pixels.

26
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,530
The higher the value, the
more rounded corners

27
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,210
are going to be.

28
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,730
The lower the value, the less
rounded the corners

29
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:32,840
are going to be.

30
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,190
Now, a quick note here, some of
these CSS properties don't

31
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,360
show up the same in every
browser, surprise, surprise.

32
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,240
So in this case, for the
border-radius property, we

33
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,560
need to add vendor prefixes
for WebKit and Mozilla.

34
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,370
So we want to put our vendor
prefixes before

35
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,370
the main CSS property.

36
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,180
So in this case, we have WebKit
border-radius and

37
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,690
Mozilla border-radius,
before our standard

38
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:57,940
border-radius property.

39
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,670

40
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,970
Next, let's look
at text-shadow.

41
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,160
Text-shadow adds a vertical
and horizontal

42
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,660
offset shadow to text.

43
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,100
And we have the ability to
control direction, blur, and

44
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,550
the color of the shadow.

45
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,690
Now, just like border radius,
before, in order to get this

46
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,980
effect, we would have
to save out images.

47
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,570
Now, we can create shadows on
text, by using this property.

48
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,370
So if we look at an example
here, we have an image from

49
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,740
designswap.com.

50
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,620
And if you notice that the name,
Phil Coffman, that's

51
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,120
actually text with
a text shadow.

52
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,450
So the way that we render
this property is

53
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,030
with a couple of values.

54
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,570
First, we have the
x-offset value.

55
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,750
Then, we have the
y-offset value.

56
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,210
Then, we have the blur value.

57
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,420
So by setting these values,
we can create a variety of

58
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,510
different shadows
for our text.

59
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,310
And then, finally, we can
also set the color.

60
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,100
So one quick design
note here--

61
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,660
we all probably know how to
create a drop shadow.

62
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,450
But what if we wanted to create
a letter-press effect?

63
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:01,400
That is the text being stamped
into the page.

64
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,490
Well, if we wanted to do that,
something to remember is-- if

65
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:07,870
you have a light background
and dark text, you want to

66
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,980
create a shadow that's
offset bottom-right,

67
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,180
with a light color.

68
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,100
Or as in this case, with this
image, we have a darker

69
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,030
background and light text.

70
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,550
So we want our shadow to be
offset to the top-left and in

71
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,790
a darker color.

72
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,120
By playing around with a variety
of different values

73
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,650
with the text-shadow property,
you can create some pretty

74
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,900
awesome effects in CSS.

75
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,210

76
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,390
Let's move on now
to box-shadow.

77
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,370
Box-shadow adds a shadow
to a non-text element.

78
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,050
And it basically follows the
same syntax as text-shadow.

79
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,270
So as we see in our example
here, we have an image with a

80
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,710
shadow that we can create in
CSS, as opposed to just saving

81
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,800
out an image.

82
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,310
So in this case, we have our
x-offset value, our y-offset

83
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,050
value, and our blur.

84
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,020
Now, one neat thing about
box-shadow is we can also add

85
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,390
an inset property.

86
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,050
If we wanted the shadow to be
inside of the image, as

87
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,460
opposed to outside the image,
we can use inset, with the

88
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,710
same syntax.

89
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,450

90
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,190
So next, let's look at RGBa.

91
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,150
Now, RGBa isn't a
new CS property.

92
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,770
But rather, it's a new model
for defining color in our

93
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,800
style sheet.

94
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,690
Now, previously, we would use
hex-colors to define our

95
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,240
colors in our style sheet.

96
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,950
But hex-colors didn't
give us the

97
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,910
option of defining opacity.

98
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:28,270
Now, with RGBa, we can add an
opacity value to our colors,

99
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,600
to allow them to be
more transparent.

100
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,410
So as we see here, with this
property, we have our RGBa

101
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,650
values, Red, Green, and Blue.

102
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,690
And then, the last value here,
0.5, is our Opacity Value.

103
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,220
So in this case, we can allow
colors or background imagery

104
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,680
to actually bleed through
our text, to create

105
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,930
a pretty neat effect.

106
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,950

107
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:52,550
Let's also look at HSLa, which
is an alternative model for

108
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,380
defining colors in
our style sheet.

109
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,810
Now, HSLa is preferred
by some.

110
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,360
Because it's a little bit
easier to change out the

111
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,560
values of the colors, if you
don't have RGB Values.

112
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,140
And if you're wanting to make
changes to your colors on the

113
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,960
fly, then this might be a good
property for you to use.

114
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,250
So it follows a similar
syntax to RGBa.

115
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,930
Let's look and see
how that works.

116
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,990
We have our HSLa values, which
translate to Hue, Saturation,

117
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,720
and Light, respectively.

118
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,340
And then, just like a
opacity, we have an

119
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,330
Alpha-Transparency Value.

120
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,610
So we can set that to be as
opaque as we want it.

121
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,530
Now, some of you may not
know how to find

122
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,300
the HSLa color values.

123
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,220
Well, we can actually
use Photoshop.

124
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,930
In Photoshop, we can pull
the HSB Values.

125
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,410
But sometimes, these aren't
always reliable.

126
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,640
I actually like to use Matt
Patenaude's Colors app, which

127
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,950
you can pull the HSL values
directly and import them into

128
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,760
your style sheet.

129
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,985
Or Chris Coyier has a pretty
slick interface called the

130
00:05:48,985 --> 00:05:51,140
HSLa Explorer, which
allows you to

131
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,810
pull HSLa values directly.

132
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:56,230
Next, let's move on to
the Opacity property.

133
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,940
The Opacity property defines
how opaque an image or an

134
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,280
object could be.

135
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,900
So we've talked about RGBa
and HSLa for text.

136
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,310
Now, let's talk about
opacity for images.

137
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,520
So in this case, we can set the
opacity of an image, by

138
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,930
using this property.

139
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,480
This is nice because now, we
don't have to save out

140
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,080
transparent images.

141
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,860
Instead, we could save out full
images and then adjust

142
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,940
the opacity, using CSS.

143
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,500
This gives us a lot more variety
and makes it easier

144
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,890
for us to change values.

145
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,940
Next, let's look at the CSS
Transform property.

146
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,170
The CSS transform property
allows elements rendered by

147
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:37,150
CSS to be transformed in
two-dimensional space.

148
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,650
So this is commonly used maybe
on a hover state for an image,

149
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,130
if we wanted that image to
break out of its space,

150
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,390
without affecting the
surrounding elements.

151
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,500
Dan Cederholm does this on the
Popular site, Dribbble.

152
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,820
And we can see here, with
his color tags.

153
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,230
So the blue on the hover state
actually pops out of the

154
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,820
surrounding elements
but doesn't

155
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,250
negatively affect them.

156
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,130
So here's what the code
might look like.

157
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,600
We have an Unordered List.

158
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,710
And then, on hover, we set our
CSS transform property.

159
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,490
Now notice, we have
vendor prefixes in

160
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,820
this property as well.

161
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,680
We've also added a vendor
prefix for Opera.

162
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,595
Now, we don't always have to add
a vendor prefix for Opera.

163
00:07:14,595 --> 00:07:16,810
But in this case, we do.

164
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,290
So we've chosen to use
the scale property

165
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,700
for this CSS transform.

166
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,270
And basically, what that means
is we're going to be scaling

167
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,800
the image by 50%.

168
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,120
We could also use one of the
other three properties

169
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,880
available, rotate, skew, or
translate, which moves the

170
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,210
image along the x and y-axes.

171
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,890
Next, let's look at
CSS transitions.

172
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:41,330
CSS transitions allow property
changes in CSS values to occur

173
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,750
smoothly over a specified
duration.

174
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,350
Basically, what this means is we
can create some pretty cool

175
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,440
transition or roll-over
effects, without using

176
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,760
JavaScript.

177
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,290
So if we had a button that we
wanted to add a transformation

178
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:57,050
to and not just a hover state,
we could do that.

179
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,550
Now, we're going to get into the
CSS transition property a

180
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,500
little bit more in depth,
later on in the course.

181
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,220
So bear with me there.

182
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,420
Next, let's look at
CSS gradients.

183
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,530
CSS gradients create a
transition from one color to

184
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,140
another, without the
use of images.

185
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,580
So we all should be familiar
with how to create a gradient

186
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,610
for a button, say
in Photoshop.

187
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,220
But this makes it super easy
to create gradients in CSS,

188
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,270
once again, gives you a ton of
variety, and allows you to

189
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,750
change elements on the fly.

190
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,710
So we have our sample image
here, "THAT'S NO MOON." Now,

191
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,470
the syntax for this property
is a little unintuitive.

192
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,350
And it actually renders
differently in each browser.

193
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:37,700
So I've found that the easiest
way to generate CSS gradients

194
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,000
is to use a pretty cool little
tool from John Allsopp.

195
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,090
He's created an editor
in which you can

196
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,300
just input your colors.

197
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,080
And it automatically spits out
the CSS code that you need to

198
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,270
put in your style sheet.

199
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,080
So in this case, for our "THAT'S
NO MOON" button,

200
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,540
here's how we would
generate the CSS.

201
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,770
We have our background
image property.

202
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,990
And instead of including an
image URL, we've actually set

203
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,660
a gradient.

204
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,270
So you'll notice we have a
WebKit vendor prefix here, as

205
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,530
well as a Mozilla
vendor prefix.

206
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,170
And you can see how
they're different.

207
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,470
But basically, we've created a
gradient with a button, with

208
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:15,130
rounded corners, simply using
CSS, pretty cool.

209
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,020
The multiple backgrounds
property allows us to add

210
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,550
multiple background images to
our page or within our page.

211
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,610
In this example, from Naz
Hamid's Lost World's Fairs

212
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,530
site, he's actually added a
couple of background images.

213
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:30,610
So that as you're scrolling down
the page, the different

214
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,370
images move at a
different rate.

215
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,230
So it almost gives a
parallax effect.

216
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,960
So here's what the code might
look like from Naz's site.

217
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,610
He's actually got two
images in this

218
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:43,690
case, bg.jpg and tile.jpg.

219
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,740
Now, what you want to remember
is the image closest to the

220
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,270
user on the screen needs
to be listed first

221
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,290
in your image stack.

222
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,300
So in this case that would
be background.jpg.

223
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,900

224
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,270
My friend Dan Higby has recently
done this in one of

225
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,530
his blog posts.

226
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,320
He's added multiple
background images.

227
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,640
So as you scroll down the page
and read more of his posts,

228
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,160
the background image changes.

229
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,040
And it also moves because he's
got a variety of background

230
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,150
images, within each section.

231
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,940
You really can create
a lot of neat

232
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,470
effects, using this property.

233
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,960
Now, we're going to look at
a real fonts on the web.

234
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,660
Now, if you remember the old
days, we were limited to just

235
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,460
a few safe fonts.

236
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,020
Arial, Helvetica, Georgia,
or Times New Roman.

237
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,140
Well, now, the age of rich
internet typography is here.

238
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,080
And we have a ton of options,
when it comes to embedding

239
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,840
fonts on our website.

240
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,270
Now, there are several different
varieties of fonts

241
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,385
that we can use on
our websites.

242
00:10:40,385 --> 00:10:42,760
Andy Clark has created a pretty
helpful table in his

243
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,550
Hardboiled Web Design book.

244
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,160
Some of the more common fonts
are OpenType or TrueType.

245
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,640
We also have the Web Open Font
format, which is kind of like

246
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,750
a compressed file of OpenType
and TrueType fonts.

247
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,140
So with the compressed file
size, as well as additional

248
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,020
security features, I think we'll
start seeing this become

249
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:04,040
more of the norm in browser
supported fonts.

250
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,320
Now, CSS3 gives us a property
for using real fonts in our

251
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,930
style sheets.

252
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,830
It's called @font-face.

253
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,405
In font-face, we have three
values that we need to declare

254
00:11:13,405 --> 00:11:14,750
in our style sheet.

255
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,480
The first is a font file.

256
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,500
The second is an @font-face
declaration, where we'll list

257
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,040
the font family, the source, and
the format of that font.

258
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,980
And then finally, we
can include that

259
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,840
font in our font stack.

260
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,920
Now, an easy way of doing this
is go to a website called Font

261
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,650
Squirrel, which has a variety
of free-to-use fonts.

262
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:37,660
And they also generate the
@font-face properties for you.

263
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,410
So all you need to do is copy
and paste, put those at the

264
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:43,500
top of your style sheet,
and you're good to go.

265
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,620
Now the @font-face property is
still the most reliable way,

266
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,540
in my opinion, of embedding
fonts into your website.

267
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,120
But in the past year, we've seen
a number of new startups

268
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,770
really advancing the technology
and web typography.

269
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,230
We have Typekit.

270
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,630
We have webfonts.fonts.com.

271
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,200
And then, we also have Google
getting into the mix with

272
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,790
Google Fonts.

273
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,990
So now, you have a variety of
options, when it comes to rich

274
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,050
web typography.

275
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,760
The bottom line is we're no
longer limited to the old,

276
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,860
safe fonts.

277
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,980
We have a number of different
options, when it comes to

278
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,410
embedding real fonts
into our website.

279
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,330
It takes a little bit of extra
work and preparation.

280
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,940
But the results and the overall
user experience is

281
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,325
much more positive.

282
00:12:24,325 --> 00:12:27,040
Now, as designers and
developers, we know that our

283
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,750
sites might not look the
same in every browser.

284
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,000
But that's OK.

285
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,410
Now, notice I didn't it was OK
for our sites to look broken.

286
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,430
But we understand that there
might be small variances, from

287
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,110
browser to browser.

288
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,550
And as long as we're creating
adequate fall backs in our

289
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,070
style sheets and in our markup,
we can use some of

290
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,190
these new features
to create rich

291
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,260
experiences for our users.

292
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,760
Now, when it comes to browser
compatibility, Dan Cederholm

293
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,570
has put together a helpful
table in his

294
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,700
CSS3 for Web Designers.

295
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,560
He lists out the main CSS3
properties and how they're

296
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,180
supported in today's
contemporary browsers.

297
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,790
Now, you'll notice that Internet
Explorer 9 is the

298
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,530
only version of IE that
currently supports a lot of

299
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:10,210
these CSS3 properties, with the
exception of text-shadow.

300
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,440
So you want to make sure, in
particular, if you're looking

301
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,000
to support IE 8 or below, that
you're providing fallback

302
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,300
properties in your
CSS style sheets.

303
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:24,520
But let me also say this, as
great as CSS3 and HTML5 are,

304
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,860
we haven't arrived.

305
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,640
And it's our job, as designers
and developers, to make sure

306
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,640
that we're putting the user
first and creating experiences

307
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,140
that are going to be positive
for our users.

308
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,180
So just because we have elements
that we can use

309
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,650
doesn't mean that we should.

310
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,540
Remember, the most valuable tool
in your creative arsenal

311
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,760
is your mind.

312
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,330
So think through how you want to
design and how you want to

313
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,290
develop sites and use some of
these properties where you

314
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,890
think they're necessary.

315
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:54,080
As craftsmen of the web, our job
is to use the tools at our

316
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,570
disposal to create the
best experience

317
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,360
possible for our users.

318
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,660
Now, users probably won't know
that you've used some of these

319
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,950
specific elements in CSS3.

320
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,780
But that's OK.

321
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,190
As long as they're functioning
properly, they're going to

322
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,840
have a great experience.

323
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,210
But if they have a negative
experience, they're not going

324
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:14,290
to care if you use text-shadow
or RGBa values.

325
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,510
All they're going to care about
is the experience that

326
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,620
they have, when visiting
your website.

327
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,490
So make sure that you design
responsibly, that you're

328
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,960
taking everything into
consideration and always

329
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,370
putting your user first.

330
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,980
So now it's time to apply what
you've learned in this level.

331
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,230
Let's get to coding.

332
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:34,674
