1
00:00:00,464 --> 00:00:01,856
[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:01,856 --> 00:00:03,760
You're watching 3 for 5.

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,050
I'm Jason VanLue, and
this is Level Four.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:32,890
[MUSIC PLAYING]

5
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,670
In this level, we're going to
be focusing on content.

6
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,450
Now content can mean a lot of
different things, but in this

7
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,030
case we're going to be referring
to content as the

8
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,770
inside of your site.

9
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,550
So we're not going to be
talking just about text

10
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,070
content, but we're going to be
looking more high level-- so,

11
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,620
how your information is laid
out, and what sort of

12
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,580
information you're including on
each of your pages in order

13
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,920
to optimize usability and
ultimately optimize user

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,670
experience for your site.

15
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,060
So in this level we're going
to continue to use our case

16
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,230
study website Border
and Radius site.

17
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,210
But before we do that, let's
go over a couple of points

18
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,460
related to content.

19
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,290
So first, you want to
have a strategy.

20
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,100
It's essential to
have a content

21
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,850
strategy for your site.

22
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,600
You don't just want to put
content on there without

23
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,240
thinking about how that affects
your users and how

24
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,910
that affects your overall
user experience.

25
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,960
Second, you want to get an ID.

26
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,980
Now, what this means is

27
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,420
information design is critical.

28
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,870
How you lay out your information
is just as

29
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,790
important as what sort of
information you're including

30
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,750
on each page.

31
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,310
Third, easy does it.

32
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,350
Now, just because you can use
something doesn't necessarily

33
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,630
mean that you should.

34
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,260
So for example, just because
you can use some of these

35
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,000
great new CSS3 elements doesn't
mean you always should

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,470
use those on your page.

37
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,650
You want to make sure that
you're keeping your user in

38
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,370
mind and making sure that
everything that you do goes

39
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,500
down to the bottom line, and
that's affecting and

40
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,060
optimizing your user
experience.

41
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,390
So just like we've been doing
throughout this course, we're

42
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,130
going to focus on three primary

43
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,590
elements in this level--

44
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,810
design, markup, and style.

45
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,120
So let's go ahead and jump on
over the Border and Radius

46
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,740
site and talk about some of the
design strategy that we

47
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,150
used to design the site.

48
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,190
So we have a few content
sections on this page.

49
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,490
First, we have our main
promotional area which

50
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,550
includes an image and some
promotional copy highlighting

51
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,040
the brewhouse's plethora
of beer selections.

52
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,120
Additionally, we have links
to the two menus below.

53
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,970
Now, the strategy here is to
create quick hit elements that

54
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,750
give the user a sense
of what Border and

55
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,180
Radius is all about.

56
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,340
By including a large image,
large typographic elements,

57
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,850
and large links to the menus,
the user can quickly identify

58
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,660
what this place is all about.

59
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,740
We also have three content
blocks beneath which contain

60
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,750
more important elements that the
client wanted to feature.

61
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,280
Border and Radius is in the news
a lot, so this section

62
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,770
gives users a chance to see how
it has been received in

63
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,990
the community.

64
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,100
They also have a pretty sweet
lunch special running, so that

65
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,380
needs some prominence, and
Border and Radius does a lot

66
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,190
of e-marketing, so the client
wanted to make sure that a

67
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,550
email sign up was prominent
and easy to use.

68
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,150
Throughout a pretty simple,
grid layout, we're able to

69
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,940
accommodate the major features
of the site with a

70
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,940
little bit of flair--

71
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,870
namely in the beer selection
highlighting

72
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,470
and top promo section.

73
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,720
So let's move on to the markup
for this section.

74
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,270
So for a markup, we're going
to start with this section

75
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,690
that you see here.

76
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,360
We have a large image and then
we have a section to the

77
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,740
right, which contain some
important information about

78
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,870
their beer selections, and then
we have two key buttons

79
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,000
that link to the food menu
and the beer menu.

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,630
So previously before HTML5, we
might have marked up this

81
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,740
section like this.

82
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:52,210
We have our div id promotional
with our large image there,

83
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,300
and then we have an unordered
list contained within a div id

84
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,690
selections that showcases
the beer selection.

85
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,660
Now I want to call your
attention to a couple of those

86
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,200
elements that are within italic
and span classes.

87
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,400
Now, we'll get to those
later when we

88
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,070
actually style this section.

89
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:10,030
Finally, our two menu buttons
below are going to be included

90
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,440
within two anchors.

91
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,850
So how might we change
this to HTML5?

92
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,920
Well, it's actually a pretty
simple change in this case.

93
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,360
Since this is a grouping of
related content, we can go

94
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,160
ahead and replace our
div with a section.

95
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,290
So in this case we're going to
add our HTML section tag in

96
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,380
place of our div id promotional,
and there we go.

97
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,730
Let's take a look at our
markup in the browser.

98
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,180
So it's nice and clean and
semantic in HTML5.

99
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,230
So let's move onto our block
elements underneath our

100
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,540
promotional section.

101
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,580
So as you can see we
have three boxes--

102
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,890
our latest news, current
specials, and

103
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,850
email newsletter box.

104
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,290
So let's go ahead and take a
look at how we might markup

105
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,510
latest news.

106
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,070
Well, first, we have
a containing

107
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,720
element div id blocks.

108
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,170
Now, I won't be referring to
that as we move forward, but

109
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:01,750
just wanted that that's in there
as a containing element.

110
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,540
So previously we might have
marked up our newsbox like so

111
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,510
with a div id news and h2 for
the title of that box, and

112
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,320
then each news item we might
have marked up with a class--

113
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,500
so in this case, div class
news-item, with the title of

114
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,730
the news item, and then the
actual content beneath it.

115
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,090
So in HTML5, we're going to make
a couple of changes that

116
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,810
will help to organize our markup
a little bit better.

117
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,100
First, we can go ahead and
replace our div id news with

118
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,840
sections, because this is,
once again, a grouping of

119
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,580
related content.

120
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,020
Next, we're going to add our
header tag in place of our h2.

121
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,110
So in this case, we're going to
add our header tag within

122
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,970
an h1, with the title
Latest News.

123
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:44,090
Now, each news item is an
independent composition.

124
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,910
So if you remember before when
were talking about HTML5 tags,

125
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,700
we talked about the
article tag.

126
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,740
This is a great place to go
ahead and use that tag.

127
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,170
So we're going to replace our
div class news-item with an

128
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,440
article tag.

129
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,170
Now the next thing that we're
going to do is since we have a

130
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:05,010
title within each news item or
within each article, we can go

131
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:09,370
ahead and add another header
element with an h1.

132
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,800
So if you remember, I mentioned
before that you can

133
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,880
use HTML5 elements like the
header tag in multiple areas

134
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,670
of your page.

135
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,870
And you can see as we've marked
up this site, we've

136
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,330
actually used the header
tag quite a bit.

137
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,700
Now, that does mean that
we have a lot of header

138
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,610
tags in h1s.

139
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,630
Now, that may or may not
be a good thing.

140
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:31,410
It's still semantic HTML5, but
if you're more comfortable

141
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:34,510
using some of the older
practices in HTML, like h2s

142
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,470
and h3s, that's totally
fine too.

143
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,090
It's still going
to be semantic.

144
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,550
I just wanted to show you where
you could apply some of

145
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,380
these new tag elements, just so
you can see how you might

146
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,520
be able to do it
in the future.

147
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,570
So the final thing that we're
going to do to this section in

148
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:53,020
HTML5 is we can actually
introduce a new tag element.

149
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,300
In this case, it's going
to be the time tag.

150
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,030
Now, this is a pretty cool
little tag because before, we

151
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,610
might have marked up, in this
case, the published date and

152
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,030
where it was published for the
actual article in a paragraph

153
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,470
or a span tag.

154
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,900
Now we can use the HTML5 time
tag to actually give a little

155
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,470
bit more information
to the browser

156
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,550
about what we're rendering.

157
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,980
The HTML5 tag element is
made of two versions.

158
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,660
One is human readable, so in
this case it would be our

159
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:24,540
Monday, January 26, 2011, and
then the other is machine

160
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,730
readable, and this is done in
ISO format, so we're going to

161
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,020
have our year, month, and
day in that order.

162
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,700
And you can also add hours,
minutes, seconds if you wanted

163
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,810
to, but we're not going
to do that here.

164
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,990
So you can see in our code that
we've added time, date

165
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,960
time, in the ISO format,
2011-01-26, and then we've

166
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,590
also added pubdate to the
end of that string.

167
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,450
Now what does that do?

168
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,930
Well, in this case, since it's
an article pubdate tells the

169
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,810
browser that this is the actual
published date of the

170
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,510
article, as opposed to just
a generic time or date.

171
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,700
So this is great if you're doing
news posts or actual

172
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,280
articles, because you can go
ahead and tell the browser in

173
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:07,130
your markup that this is an
actual published date.

174
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,470
Now that we've marked up our
latest news, let's go ahead

175
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,890
and mark up our current
specials box.

176
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,030
Now this is a pretty
straightforward piece of

177
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,480
markup here, so I won't spend
too much time on it.

178
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,720
But previously before HTML5, we
might have marked it up to

179
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,110
look something like this.

180
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,670
We have our div id specials,
just like before we had our

181
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,890
latest news, we have our h2 with
the title, and then we

182
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,810
have our image with paragraph
copy underneath.

183
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,240
So how might we change
this to HTML5?

184
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,850
Well, we're going to
do two things.

185
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,559
First, we're going to replace
our div with a section once

186
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,360
again, because it's a grouping
of related content.

187
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,210
And then next, we're going to
add our header tag in place of

188
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,430
h2 for current specials.

189
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,460
So the final piece of
markup would be our

190
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,760
email newsletter box.

191
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,840
But in this case, we're going to
go ahead and leave that to

192
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,450
the next level where we can
spend a little bit more time

193
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,460
talking about the new elements
in HTML5 forms.

194
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,850
So now that we've marked up our
first two boxes, let's go

195
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,120
ahead and move into style.

196
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,340
So let's review just a little
bit about what we're going to

197
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,010
be styling.

198
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,160
First, we're going to style
our promotional area

199
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,370
like you see here.

200
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,560
So if you can remember, we have
our large image, we have

201
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,370
our beer selections copy,
and then we have

202
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,130
our two menu items.

203
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,730
So let's go ahead and get our
basic styles out of the way

204
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,560
first like you see here.

205
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,120
Now what we're going to do it
our image is we're actually

206
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,320
going to add a box shadow to
sort of set it out of the page

207
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,280
a little bit more and help to
match the rest of the styling

208
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,190
on the site.

209
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,360
So in this case, we're going
to use our vendor prefixes

210
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,870
first and add a box shadow
like you see here.

211
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,780
Let's take a look at how that
might render in the browser.

212
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,250
Now we could leave our image
just like that, but let's go

213
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,920
ahead and add a hover state.

214
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,560
We're going to use our new CSS3
transform property and

215
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,550
we're going to use the code
like you see here.

216
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:53,190
So in this case, we're going to
scale the image by 10%, 1.1

217
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,650
and we're actually going
to rotate it

218
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,720
negative two degrees.

219
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,530
So in this case, we're going
to rotate it to the left.

220
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,500
Remember with the CSS3 transform
property, you're

221
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,340
actually not going to affect the
other elements surrounding

222
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,830
the image, so we're actually
getting get a hover state that

223
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,260
looks like this.

224
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,840
It's a way to interact with the
image a little bit more

225
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,140
without negatively affecting the
rest of your site, which

226
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,320
is pretty cool.

227
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,050
Now let's move on to our copy,
highlighting the beer

228
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,700
selections at Border
and Radius.

229
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,970
Now before, I might have used
images to render what you see

230
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,840
here, but thanks to CSS3, we
can now to render this

231
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,570
natively in the browser.

232
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,710
Let's go ahead and take a look
at how we might do that.

233
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,640
First, let's recall
our markup.

234
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,510
So in this case, we have
an unordered list

235
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,370
with three list items.

236
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,130
And once again, remember, I
mentioned let's take note on

237
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,030
italic and span classed that
we have in each of those,

238
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,500
because we're going to be
styling those individually to

239
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,150
create some cool effects.

240
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,280
So here are basic styles.

241
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,750
Now if you notice, we're going
to use LeagueGothic again,

242
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,840
which we @font-face'd earlier, and
we're also going to add a

243
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,150
text shadow.

244
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,540
In this case, we're going to add
a letter press effect like

245
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,120
we talked about before to sort
of have the text sit

246
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,330
inside of the page.

247
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,350
Alright, so let's take a look
at how that renders.

248
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,690
Now the first image is our
styles before we added any of

249
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:12,050
our CSS3 properties, and the
second image is what it looks

250
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,210
like after we've added our font
face and our text shadow.

251
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,560
So this looks good, but I'd
like to be able to do

252
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,840
something a little bit
more to the text.

253
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,100
And if you remember, our on is
actually sitting within a

254
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,800
italic element, so let's
go ahead and style that

255
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,570
a little bit more.

256
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,970
So in this case, we're going
to use a different font,

257
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:34,010
MarketingScriptRegular, Script
which we @font-face'd earlier.

258
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,030
So now if we take a look at
how that renders in the

259
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:40,386
browser, you can see we have a
nice, subtle little effect on

260
00:11:40,386 --> 00:11:42,890
the on portions of our copy,
which helps to set

261
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,790
it apart even more.

262
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,480
Finally, we're going
to style the actual

263
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,450
numbers of this section.

264
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,510
So here you can see how our
styles might be coded out.

265
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,030
Once again, we're going to use
LeagueGothic, but in this case

266
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,490
we're going to increase the
font size to 75 pixels.

267
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,700
Now, additionally, we've added
another class to the middle

268
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,350
list item just to make sure
that it aligns properly.

269
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,810
So let's go ahead and take a
look at how that renders in

270
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:08,200
the browser.

271
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,780
So the first image you see is
our styles without our CSS3

272
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,960
properties added in, and the
second image is after we've

273
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,110
added our CSS3 properties.

274
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,450
So this is pretty cool, because
previously we would

275
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,910
have only been able to
do this with images.

276
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:25,740
Now we can do this natively in
CSS3 and create some pretty

277
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,720
cool effects and an optimal
user experience.

278
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,770
Alright, finally, we're going
to style our two menu item

279
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,440
buttons, so let's go ahead
recall our markup to make sure

280
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,570
we understand what we're
working with here.

281
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,980
So if you remember, we have our
two anchor elements that

282
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,240
are virtually the same,
so that's nice.

283
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,700
Let's go ahead and take care
of our basic styles first.

284
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,920
So here they are, and one thing
to take note of-- as you

285
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,230
can notice in our background,
we've set our RGBA color but

286
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,525
we've also set an opacity
value of 0.5.

287
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:56,750
Now later on, we're going to
set a hover state because

288
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,860
these are links, and we're
actually going to make this

289
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,580
image a little bit
less opaque.

290
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,370
So we'll get to that
in a minute.

291
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,825
So let's take a look at how our
buttons render with just

292
00:13:05,825 --> 00:13:07,910
these basic styles added.

293
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,680
Alright, so let's get a little
crazy with CSS3.

294
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,330
So in this case, we're going to
add rounded corners again

295
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,210
but we're going to do things
a little bit differently.

296
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:18,990
We're only going to round the
top left and bottom right

297
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,850
corners of these buttons.

298
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,690
So we're going to add code
that looks like this.

299
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:26,250
We have our vendor prefixes
first and then our standard

300
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,260
properties, but you can see that
instead of just saying

301
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,120
border radius, we've actually
declared which

302
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,630
corner we want to round--

303
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:36,840
so in this case, top left and
bottom right, and we've given

304
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,010
a value of 10 pixels for each.

305
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,960
Additionally, we're going to add
a text shadow to our text

306
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,640
to give it that letter press
effect once again.

307
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,990
So let's go ahead and take a
look at how that renders.

308
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,830
And as you can see, we no
longer have just basic

309
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:50,500
rectangles.

310
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,750
We're able to round certain
corners of the image, which is

311
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,280
kind of neat.

312
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,570
It's a little bit different than
going ahead and rounding

313
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,320
all of the corners.

314
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,290
Alright, so we're
not quite done.

315
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,470
Finally, we're going to add a

316
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,780
transition to our menu buttons.

317
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,220
So in this case, we're going
to set our vendor prefixes

318
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,830
first with our standard property
after, and we're

319
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,980
going to transition all of the
elements, so the button and

320
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,040
the text included
in the button.

321
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,300
We're going to do that for 0.3
seconds and we're going to use

322
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,710
our default ease in
out function.

323
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,660
We're also going to add our
hover state with the styles

324
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,300
that you see here.

325
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,070
Now, remember I mentioned before
that our static state

326
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,700
had an opacity value of 0.5.

327
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,900
Now we're going to add an
opacity value of 0.9.

328
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,800
So the static state of the
button is actually more opaque

329
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,140
and when you roll over it,
it's going to become less

330
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,170
opaque, which is going to be
kind of a neat little rollover

331
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,400
effect that you can do with
just a few easy CSS3

332
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,730
properties.

333
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,560
Let's go ahead and add a few
more styles to our text.

334
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,870
So in this case, we have a span
element in our text on

335
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,730
the button and we're going to
add MarketingScript as the

336
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,190
font for that element.

337
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,760
And then lastly, we're going
to add a pseudoclass to the

338
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,130
right button just to make sure
that it aligns properly with

339
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,900
the rest of our elements.

340
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,520
So let's go ahead and take a
live look in the browser at

341
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,420
how all of this renders.

342
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,920
So we have our large promo
image, and you can see the

343
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,180
rollover effect we added with
our transform property.

344
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,050
Additionally, we have our beer
selections copy, styled with

345
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,620
@font-face and text shadow, and
our menu buttons provide

346
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,120
clear call to action points with
great CSS3 properties,

347
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,570
including the smooth transition
that we created for

348
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,820
the hover state.

349
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,460
OK, so now that we're done
styling our promotional

350
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,070
section, let's go ahead and move
onto our block elements

351
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,200
underneath.

352
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,570
So first, let's look at the
basics styles that we're going

353
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:42,320
to use to style some of the
shared elements that each of

354
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,930
these boxes have.

355
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,850
Alright, so here are
our basic styles.

356
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,190
So we have our blocks containing
element, we have

357
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:52,570
our section, we have a
pseudoclass for the last box

358
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:56,120
in this section, and then we
also have our shared titles

359
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,460
across all three boxes, which
in this case, we're going to

360
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,140
go with MarketingScriptRegular.

361
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,670
So let's go ahead and focus now
on the latest newsbox and

362
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,430
look how we might style that.

363
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,460
So let's go ahead and recall
our markup for

364
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,140
this particular box.

365
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,940
We have our section id news,
we have our header for the

366
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,620
title Latest News, and then
we have our various

367
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,570
news items or articles.

368
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:22,050
Alright, so first we're going to
get our basic styles out of

369
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,810
the way that pretty much just
styles out the text in each

370
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,230
one of our articles.

371
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,400
So you can see how we might
style those here.

372
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,740
Let's go ahead and take a look
at how that might render in

373
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,370
the browser.

374
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,030
So the first image that you
see is before we've added

375
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,550
these properties and the second
image is after we've

376
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:41,990
added some of these new
properties to our elements.

377
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:44,180
Alright, now we could stop
there, but we're actually

378
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,930
going to create a pretty cool
little hover state for each of

379
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,020
our articles.

380
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,890
So let's look at the
basic style that

381
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,050
we're going to need.

382
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,530
Now, one thing I want to call
your attention to in this case

383
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,140
is the width property.

384
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,900
Currently, it's at 285 pixels.

385
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,630
Now, for our rollover state,
we're actually going to create

386
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:04,520
a rollover effect in which the
background extends out of the

387
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,970
containing box.

388
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,730
So I just want you to keep that
width in mind-- we'll

389
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,000
come back to it in a minute.

390
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,770
So the first thing that we're
going to do is we're going to

391
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,400
add rounded corners.

392
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,109
But just like our menu buttons
in our promotional section,

393
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:18,369
we're not going to round
every corner.

394
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:20,770
In this case, we're only going
to round the corners on the

395
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,760
right side-- so, the top right
and the bottom right--

396
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,790
and we would do this by
providing the code like this.

397
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,880
We have our vendor prefixes
and then our standard

398
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,860
properties, and in this case,
we have top right and bottom

399
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,505
right with a radius
of five pixels.

400
00:17:34,505 --> 00:17:36,710
So next, we're going to
add a transition.

401
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:39,640
Now we could just use a basic
hover state so when you roll

402
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,020
over that particular item it
would just have a standard

403
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,300
rollover effect, but with CSS3
we can create pretty cool

404
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,060
transitions for our hover
states, so that's what we're

405
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,270
going to do here, and we're
actually going to create two

406
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,650
transitions.

407
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,220
So the first that we're going to
do is transition the width.

408
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,990
We're actually going to have the
background break outside

409
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,580
of the containing box, and then
the second thing we're

410
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,600
going to do is have the
background transition as well.

411
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,040
So here's the code that
we're going to use

412
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,380
to make that happen.

413
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,870
Our first transition involves
the width and we're going to

414
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:12,600
say linear, because we want it
to happen on a linear model.

415
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,870
And the second transition that
we're going to use is we're

416
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,680
actually going to transition
the background--

417
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,400
in this case, we're going
to have it ease.

418
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,170
Finally, we're going to add our
hover state, and in this

419
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:26,840
case, we're going to add an
opacity value of 0.5.

420
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,060
If you remember, our background
previously didn't

421
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:29,890
have any color.

422
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,340
It was just the standard
background of

423
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,770
the containing element.

424
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,540
In this case, we want to add a
color so that when you hover

425
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,750
over it, the background can
transition into a color, but

426
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,300
we'd like to keep it semi-opaque
so that it brings

427
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,530
out some of the texture from
the underlying elements.

428
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:47,450
So let's go ahead and take a
live look at how that renders

429
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,890
to give you a good idea
of what we can

430
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,320
accomplish with CSS3.

431
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,220
First, let's take a quick look
at our news section without all

432
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,585
the CSS3 properties
that we added in.

433
00:18:56,585 --> 00:18:59,120
Now you can see, it's fairly
basic and kind of

434
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,500
boring, to be honest.

435
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,160
Now let's see how much better
this section looks by adding a

436
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,280
few simple CSS3 properties, and
check out the nifty hover

437
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,200
effect that we added through
CSS transitions.

438
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,960
We're able to break the confines
of the box, we've got

439
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,360
rounded corners, and we've got
our opacity value that really

440
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,400
helps to spruce up
this section.

441
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,640
Alright, so our last task
is to style the

442
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,840
current specials section.

443
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,400
Now let's go ahead and recall
our markup, and if you can

444
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,050
remember, it's pretty
straightforward.

445
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,720
We have our section, our header,
our image, and then we

446
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,930
have our paragraph
copy underneath.

447
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:35,500
So let's go ahead and get our
basic styles out of the way,

448
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,650
and as I mentioned, these are
pretty straightforward

449
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,840
But one thing we want to
focus on is the image.

450
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,800
Now, we could leave the images
static, but let's go ahead and

451
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,610
add a pretty cool
hover effect.

452
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,100
So in this case, we're going to
do a similar thing like we

453
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,490
did with our promotional image
above and we're going to add a

454
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,450
CSS transform property.

455
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,890
We're going to rotate it
negative five degrees.

456
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,630
So in this case, when we hover
over it, it's going to rotate

457
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,360
a little bit to the left and
just give a nice subtle user

458
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,280
experience factor.

459
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,490
And let's go ahead and check out
what that looks like when

460
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,130
you hover over this element.

461
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,800
Alright, so let's go back to our
Border and Radius site and

462
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,560
do a quick review of all of the
elements that we styled

463
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,190
and marked up in this level.

464
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,050
Alright, so let's do a
quick review here.

465
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,940
We have our promo section with
our large promo image and its

466
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,190
nifty little hover state
that we created.

467
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,790
We have our beer selections
elements rendered in rich web

468
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,720
fonts, we have our menu buttons
with rounded corners,

469
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,090
text shadow, and a nice smooth
transition on hover.

470
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,760
And as we move into our block
elements, we've already hit on

471
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,270
our news section and how much
the CSS3 properties add to the

472
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,840
overall experience, including
that hover state.

473
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,950
And then finally, we've got our
specials section and our

474
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,480
nifty little hover state
for our image.

475
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,590
We've managed to create a rich
user experience with just a

476
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:54,480
few subtle effects in CSS3 and
effectively organized our

477
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,640
markup using HTML5.

478
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:01,140
[MUSIC PLAYING]

479
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,590
Alright, so now it's time for
you to apply what you've

480
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,580
learned in this level.

481
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,380
So let's go ahead and
jump into the code.
