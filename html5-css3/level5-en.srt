1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,440
In this level we're going
to be talking

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,480
about footers and forms.

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,730
Now we have some great new form
elements is HTML5, so

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,840
we're going to start with those
first, and then we'll

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,470
close out the course
with our footer.

7
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,379

8
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:38,980
[MUSIC PLAYING]

9
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,730
So just like with the other
levels, we're going to be

10
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,720
using our case study site,
Border and Radius, to sort of

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,670
take us through some practical
application

12
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,830
of what we're learning.

13
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,260
But first, let's go through a
couple of key points, both for

14
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,510
forms and for footers.

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,470

16
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,470
All right, so with
forms first, we

17
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,930
have intuitive usability.

18
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,130
Now what do I mean by that?

19
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,240
Well, many times your form
elements are some of the most

20
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,220
important elements
on your page.

21
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,750
They could be contact forms, or
newsletter sign ups, or a

22
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,080
lot of different things, so it's
important to keep them

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,550
intuitive and usable
for your user.

24
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,880
Second, we have no
ugly ducklings.

25
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,890
Now, forms can usually be quite
technical in nature, but

26
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,460
that doesn't mean that they
don't need design.

27
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,990
A lot of times we can just put
our forms together and not

28
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,280
really style them.

29
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,500
Since they are key elements on
our page, and a lot of times

30
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,630
have key call to action points,
it's important that we spend

31
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,710
just as much time styling them
as some of the other elements

32
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,510
on our page.

33
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,740
With our footer, first, we want
to utilize the space.

34
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,730
Now, most of our users are going
to read our websites

35
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,090
from the top down, which means
most of the time they're going

36
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,610
to end up at the bottom
where our footer is.

37
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,030
And our footer is a great area
to place navigation items, or

38
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,740
key call to action elements.

39
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,050
A lot of things can be put in
your footer if you want to

40
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,260
draw attention to them.

41
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,450
So make sure that you're
utilizing the space

42
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,840
appropriately.

43
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,410
Second, we don't want
to forget the style.

44
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,910
Just like with our forms, where
we can leave out a lot

45
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,460
of the styling, with our footer,
most of the time it's

46
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,790
the last thing that we design
because we usually design from

47
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,720
the top down, starting
with our header.

48
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,700
So we want to make sure that
we're putting, once again,

49
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,630
just as much emphasis and time
into our footer design as the

50
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,390
rest of our site.

51
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,620
All right, so let's look at
the three main points that

52
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,270
we're covering throughout
the course,

53
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,385
design, markup and style.

54
00:02:28,385 --> 00:02:30,940
Let's head back to our Border
and Radius site and take a

55
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,550
look at the design strategy
behind our form

56
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,520
and our footer elements.

57
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,130
Let's take a look at our form
element first, which is the

58
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,040
third block element
that includes a

59
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,020
newsletter sign up box.

60
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,790
Now, we could leave the styling
of the form totally up

61
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,070
to the browsers, but why give up
control when you can style

62
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,470
forms effectively and easily.

63
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,110
In this case, the design is
fairly simple since it's not

64
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,130
really a complex form, but
we've used some CSS3

65
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,230
properties, such as rounded
corners, gradients, and text

66
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,890
effects, to help the form
be more cohesive with

67
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,900
the rest of the site.

68
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,710
Moving on to the footer, with
a site like this we really

69
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,950
don't need to include
a ton of elements.

70
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,400
In this case we've chosen to
tie-in the history of Border

71
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,340
and Radius since this is an
important branding element.

72
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,500
And we carried the design
through with the monotone

73
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,130
image like you see in the
header, and have also included

74
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,790
standard navigation and
copyright elements.

75
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,180
But as with the form, we decided
to kick things up a

76
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,240
notch with CSS3 properties.

77
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,070
We'll go through these
specifically in

78
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,800
just a little bit.

79
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,890
Now that we've covered design,
let's go ahead and move on to

80
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,020
the markup.

81
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,100
Now in HTML5, as I mentioned,
we have some

82
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,020
great new form elements.

83
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,930
These includes some new input
types, native placeholder

84
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,220
text, auto-focus, and
form validation.

85
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,380
So before we hit the actual
markup, let's go through a

86
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,800
couple of these in
more detail.

87
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,920
With our email and URL input
types we can actually define

88
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,740
in the markup what type
of field that we have.

89
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,010
Now, this is great for devices
such as the iPhone or the

90
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,200
iPad, which have different
keyboards depending on what

91
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,280
sort of form field that
you're using.

92
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,560
So, in this case, we have an
email form field, and that's

93
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,930
going to generate the keyboard
that's specific for emails.

94
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,880
So this is a great usability
factor because it allows the

95
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,990
user to go directly into what
they want to do, in this case,

96
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,120
typing in their email address,
as opposed to trying to find

97
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,810
all of the characters.

98
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,840
Now our number, date and color
input types currently aren't

99
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,480
supported in contemporary
browsers all that well, but as

100
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,580
they become more supported
you're going to see them in

101
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,890
use a lot more.

102
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,230
And this is because it's going
to give, once again, some

103
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,680
great new usability features
to our forms.

104
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,990
In this case, like you can see
in the demo, we can actually

105
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,420
bring up different very shades
of color wheels or color

106
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,640
selectors to actually define
what we're looking for.

107
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,920
And we can also do the same
thing for date pickers and

108
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,450
number sliders, for example.

109
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,840
Finally, we have the search
input type, and this thing is

110
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,760
pretty slick.

111
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,200
In web browsers like Safari
and Chrome, the browser

112
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,590
actually renders rounded
corners automatically.

113
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,690
And it also adds a little x
button, just like you would

114
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,530
see in a native, say,
Mac application.

115
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,900
And this is great because if
you're entering a search and

116
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,600
all of a sudden you realize
that's not what you want to

117
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,860
search for, you can click
on that button and it

118
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,340
automatically erases
your entire search.

119
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,180
So, once again, this is a much
more usable feature and it's

120
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,200
going to allow us to do a lot
more with our form fields.

121
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,100
Now, I mentioned that webkit
browsers automatically add

122
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,160
rounded corners.

123
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,540
If this is something that you
don't necessarily want to

124
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,480
have, maybe you want to have a
custom design search field,

125
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,540
all you need to do is enter this
code in your CSS and then

126
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,400
you'll be able to style
however you want.

127
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,190

128
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,330
All right, so let's go ahead
and jump into the markup.

129
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:45,120
And first, let's take a look at
what we're actually going

130
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,930
to be marking up.

131
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,710
In this case it's our email
newsletter box.

132
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,270
So previously we might have
constructed our markup

133
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,750
to look like this.

134
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,960
We have our div id newsletter,
and then we have our various

135
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,640
form fields beneath that.

136
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,490
So in HTML5 how might
we mark this up?

137
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,580
Well, we're going to do
a couple of things.

138
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,130
First, like you would expect,
we're going to replace our top

139
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,290
level div with a section
because, once again, it's a

140
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,230
grouping of related content.

141
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,270
We're going to add our header
tag with a new h1 for email

142
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,100
newsletter, and then we're going
to do a couple of things

143
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,730
with our individual
form fields.

144
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:21,370
Let's go ahead and take a look
at those in more detail.

145
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,010
The first thing that we're going
to do, as you can see,

146
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,440
is we're going to add our input
type email, which is one

147
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,420
of those new input types
that we talked about

148
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,110
a little bit earlier.

149
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,460
We're also going to add
placeholder text.

150
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,910
Now this is pretty cool because
previously you'd only

151
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,960
be able to have placeholder text
that disappeared when you

152
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,120
clicked inside the form field
through JavaScript or

153
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,350
something like that.

154
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,100
Now we can do it natively
through HTML5.

155
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,250
So, in this case, we're just
going to add this value

156
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,380
placeholder, and then whatever
we would like to exist inside

157
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,310
of our form field.

158
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,470
In this case, it's
an email address.

159
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:56,440
Finally, if we want to make our
form fields required, all

160
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,730
we have to do is enter required
at the end of our

161
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,390
string like you see here.

162
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,250
And, natively in HTML5,
our form fields

163
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,870
are required fields.

164
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,140
All right, now that we've
completed our email newsletter

165
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,860
markup, let's go ahead and
move on to our footer.

166
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,490
Now, we're not going to be doing
anything game changing

167
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,900
in our footer markup, but we
are going to be adding a

168
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,870
couple of new HTML5 elements.

169
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,540
So let's take a look at how we
might have previously marked

170
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,240
up our footer.

171
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,730
First, we have our containing
element, which in this case is

172
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,540
div id primary foot.

173
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,630
And then we have our div ID
history section which includes

174
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,400
a little bit of information
about Border and Radius and

175
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,980
has that monotone image
like you saw before.

176
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,230
So in HTML5 we're only going to
make a couple of changes.

177
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,910
As you might expect, we're going
to change our containing

178
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,250
element, div, into
a footer tag.

179
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,400
And we're also going to change
our history section into an

180
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,280
actual HTML5 section because,
once again, it's a grouping of

181
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,810
related content.

182
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,520
We're going to add our header,
our history in this case, and

183
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,370
that wraps up the HTML5 for
that particular markup.

184
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,110

185
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,910
Next we have our footer
navigation and a little bit of

186
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,350
copyright information
below that.

187
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,250
So here's how we might have
marked that up previously.

188
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:14,230
So in HTML5, just a couple of
quick little changes here.

189
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,910
Instead of having a div ID
info, we're just going to

190
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,510
change that to section.

191
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:22,120
And instead of having div ID
footer nav, we can go ahead

192
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,970
and change that to our nav tag
because it is navigation.

193
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,370

194
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,070
All right, so now we've got our
markup complete, let's go

195
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:34,250
ahead and work on the style for
our email newsletter box

196
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,500
and our footer elements.

197
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,190

198
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,590
All right, first, let's take a
look at our markup once again

199
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,150
just to give us a reminder of
what we're working with.

200
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,880
So if you remember, we have our
section id newsletter, and

201
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,820
then our actual form fields.

202
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,730
So let's get our basic styles
out of the way first,

203
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,980
like you see here.

204
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,330

205
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,540
Next, we're going to be focusing
on styling the

206
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,770
specific fields within the
email newsletter sign up.

207
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,050
So as you can see here we're
just going to add our standard

208
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,060
border radius property with our
vendor prefixes ahead of

209
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,910
our standard property, and we're
going to add a radius

210
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,280
value of five pixels.

211
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,990
As you can see by these
images, we have

212
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,480
a before and after.

213
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,470
So before we have our just
standard rectangles, and then

214
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,590
after we have our
rounded corners.

215
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,370
Next we're going to work
on our submit button.

216
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,180
Now our submit button is pretty
cool because prior to

217
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:29,500
CSS3 we would only be able to
create this using an image.

218
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,130
For our submit button we're
going to render

219
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,130
everything in CSS3.

220
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,360
Let's go ahead and take a look
at how we might do that.

221
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,810
First, we're going to get our
basic styles out of the way

222
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,345
like you see here.

223
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,860
The next thing that we're going
to do, is we're going to

224
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,720
add text shadow, and we're also
going around the corners.

225
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,100
So, in this case, you can see
our text shadow is once again

226
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,810
our letterpress effect.

227
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,400
And we're going to add a border
radius of eight pixels.

228
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,240
Next we're going to add a CSS
gradient to our button.

229
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,180
Now if you can remember when we
covered CSS gradients back

230
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,970
in Level 2, they can be
a little bit tricky.

231
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:05,450
So for this button I've once
again used John Allsopp's CSS

232
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,250
gradient creator, and it's
given me the code

233
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,730
like you see here.

234
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,410
So, in this case, we're going to
create a gradient from kind

235
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,860
of a darker gray to a little
bit of a lighter gray.

236
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,280
And let's go ahead and take a
look at that button rendered

237
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,980
completely in CSS3
in our browser.

238
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,720
All right, so the last thing
that we're going to do for our

239
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,390
button is add a hover state.

240
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,120
Now in CSS, and in particular
CSS3, we have a number of

241
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,890
different options that we can
use for hover states.

242
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,600
You've seen a couple of those
in this course already.

243
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,190
In this case we're going to keep
it pretty simple and just

244
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:39,110
add a standard box shadow so
that when you hover over the

245
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,740
button it just lifts it off
the page a little bit.

246
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,910
So our code would look
something like this.

247
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,240
An x value of one pixel, a y
value of one pixel, and then

248
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,360
we're going to give a
three pixel blur.

249
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,040
Now the only thing to mention
here is that we've added in

250
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,150
opacity value of 0.4.

251
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,880
So we've kept the color as
standard black, and then

252
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,960
dropped the opacity to 0.4 as
opposed to trying to find a

253
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,560
gray color that works.

254
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,887
This is a quick and easy fix to
adding some drop shadow to

255
00:11:05,887 --> 00:11:08,000
your elements.

256
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,300
All right, so now that we have
that done the last thing we

257
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,990
need to do is go ahead
and style our footer.

258
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:16,350
Now our footer includes some
pretty basic style so I've

259
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:19,370
included them in the reference
slides for this course, but

260
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,720
I'm not going to go through
those in depth right now

261
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,920
because they're pretty much
just standard CSS styles.

262
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,510
What I want to do is go ahead
and jump ahead to the actual

263
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,790
CSS3 properties that we're going
to add for a couple of

264
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,200
elements in our footer.

265
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,980
So let's go ahead and take a
look at the copyright section

266
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,750
of the footer.

267
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,840
All right, so the specific
element that we're going to

268
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,250
target with CSS3 properties is
going to be the bottle image

269
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,310
next to our copyright
information.

270
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,740
So what we want to do here
is we want to add a CSS

271
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,610
transition on hover.

272
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,560
So the way that we're going to
do this is we're going to set

273
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,360
our basic styles first,
like you see here.

274
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,620
And then we're going to add our
CSS transition property.

275
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,730
Vendor prefixes first,
of course.

276
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,370
And in this case we're going to
transition the opacity of

277
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,910
the image with an ease-in-out
function like

278
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,220
we typically use.

279
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,370
And then on the hover state
we're going to add an opacity

280
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,800
value of 0.5.

281
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,470
Now, if you notice, on our
static state, we have an

282
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,040
opacity value of 0.15.

283
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,180
So in this case we're going to
be going from a more opaque

284
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,570
image in a static state,
to a less opaque image

285
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,230
in the hover state.

286
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,140
So ready to take a look
at how this fits

287
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,500
together in the browser?

288
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,380
All right, let's head on over
to Border and Radius

289
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,630
and check it out.

290
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,030

291
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,890
Let's first take a look at our
newsletter sign up form.

292
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,030
Here's a look at what this would
look like if we didn't

293
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,710
use some of our new
CSS3 properties.

294
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:42,270
Once again, it's usable, but
it's a bit boring and bland.

295
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,270
By adding CSS3 properties we
get a form that looks like

296
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:49,150
this, rounded corners, native
placeholder text, and a button

297
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:53,110
with gradients and rounded
corners all in CSS3.

298
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,810
And if we move on to our footer,
most of our content is

299
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,230
pretty straightforward.

300
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,510
You can see that we have a text
shadow with our history

301
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,340
copy, which is a nice element.

302
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,450
And you can see how we rendered
our footer background

303
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,490
to be opaque so the texture
bleeds through the color.

304
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,850
And here you can see the
transition that we added to

305
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,070
our bottle image.

306
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,530
So congratulations, we've built
the Border and Radius

307
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:17,260
homepage in semantic HTML5
markup, and with some kicking

308
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,020
CSS3 properties.

309
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,100
Hopefully this has been helpful,
functional example of

310
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,685
how to use these great
new features.

311
00:13:23,685 --> 00:13:26,210

312
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,810
But wait there's more.

313
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:30,450
Since you've made it this far,
we wanted to throw in a little

314
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,270
something special.

315
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,630
So we'd like to invite you
to have a drink on us.

316
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,880
Now what do we mean by that?

317
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,690
Well let's go back to our Border
and Radius site and

318
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,640
I'll show you.

319
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,300
So let's check out our bottle
image again, I think you'll

320
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,570
find a few things
have changed.

321
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,260
Yep, that's a spinning bottle.

322
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,820
And if you look real close you
can actually see the liquid

323
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,970
inside of the bottle
being drained.

324
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,890
So I assume you're taking us
up on our offer a drink.

325
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,180
Pretty cool, huh?

326
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,800
The power of CSS3, it really is
amazing some of the stuff

327
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,300
that we can do.

328
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,290
Now if you're interested in
taking a look at the code that

329
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,850
we used to create this, we've
included at the end of the

330
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,510
slides for this level.

331
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,780
Enjoy and cheers.

332
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,860
All right, so that concludes the
last level of the course.

333
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,990
Congratulations for making
it this far, but you're

334
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,620
not quite done yet.

335
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,990
Let's go ahead and apply what
we've learned in this level

336
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,240
and jump into the code.

337
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,629
