1
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:03,470
You're watching 3 For 5.

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:04,760
I'm Jason VanLue.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,010
And this is Level Three.

4
00:00:11,158 --> 00:00:33,460
[MUSIC PLAYING]

5
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,060
In this level, we're going to
look at header and navigation

6
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,680
elements, some of the
most important

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,380
elements on your website.

8
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,440
First, I'd like to introduce
you to our case study site

9
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,390
that we're going to be using
throughout the rest of the

10
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,260
course, to sort of
practically apply

11
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,740
what we've been learning.

12
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,840
So this is Border & Radius, a
local brew house with great

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,870
food and even better beer.

14
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,790
Sounds like my kind of place.

15
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,230
Now, we're going to be using
this site and breaking down

16
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,680
individual elements of the site,
to apply some of the

17
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,480
HTML5 and CSS3 expertise
that you now have.

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,920
As we move through each level,
we're going to be focusing on

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,680
three primary points, design,
markup, and style.

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,490
But before we go any further,
let's chat for brief moment

21
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,390
about what makes up a successful
navigation and a

22
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,640
successful header.

23
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,260
So we have five points that we
want to consider, when it

24
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,010
comes to designing and
developing effective header

25
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,180
and navigation sections
of our site.

26
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,480
The first is know your user.

27
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,010
Now you want to know your user,
no matter what site

28
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,470
you're developing.

29
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,080
A one-size-fits-all approach
to web design

30
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,240
just doesn't work.

31
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,430
So you want to make sure that
you're keeping your user in

32
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,870
mind, when you're building
these elements.

33
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,990
The second is keep it clean.

34
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,110
Now, we want to make sure that
our header and navigation

35
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,280
elements are free from
distraction.

36
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,120
So that means that we want our
branding to be prominent.

37
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,360
And maybe a couple of key
call-to-action points are also

38
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,340
appropriate for that section
that section.

39
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,740
Third, we have three
to four elements.

40
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,620
Now, we all should know what
the top priorities of the

41
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,310
sites that we're building are.

42
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,770
We should ask ourselves the
question, what do we want the

43
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,080
user to do, when they
access our site.

44
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,100
Now, all of those priorities
don't necessarily have to be

45
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,300
totally flushed out in your
header or your navigation.

46
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,170
But maybe you have a couple of
key call-to-action points or

47
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,910
key links that you want to call
your user's attention to.

48
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,410
The header is a perfect
place to put that.

49
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,040
We also want to simplify
our navigation.

50
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,130
So we don't have 28 different
links to all of our pages of

51
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,210
our site in our main
navigation.

52
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,630
I think it's a good practice to
keep our main navigation at

53
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,890
around six to eight
primary links.

54
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,930
And then, you can decide how
you want to drill down the

55
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,200
rest of your navigation
from there.

56
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,080
Finally, we want to
be a tour guide.

57
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,200
Now, it's our job as designers
and developers to guide our

58
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,040
users to where we want them
to go on the site.

59
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,450
So it's important for us to
think like a user, as we're

60
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,960
building these websites.

61
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,330
All right.

62
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,190
So let's quickly go through
some design practices and

63
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:04,130
strategy that we use to build
the Border & Radius site.

64
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,170
So in talking with the client,
over a few pints, of course,

65
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,860
we went through the five points
we discussed earlier.

66
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,240
Let's apply those points
to our design.

67
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,330
First, know your user.

68
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,940
Border & Radius knows that their
customers are drawn by

69
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,070
the history of the brew house,
as well as their changing

70
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,300
organic menu.

71
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,980
We wanted these to be featured
prominently, since each is a

72
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,040
valuable component
of the brand.

73
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,780
Second, keep it clean.

74
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,880
This section is certainly
very clean.

75
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,130
It matches up with the
restaurant's existing branding

76
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:34,060
and keeps unnecessary
distractions to a minimum.

77
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,340
Third, three to four elements,
we have two key elements,

78
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,110
history and menu, in this
section, in addition to the

79
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,140
branding elements.

80
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,410
So this works.

81
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,610
Fourth, simplify navigation.

82
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,610
We have seven links, which
is towards the

83
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,790
upper end of our limit.

84
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,650
But since we've chosen to use a
fairly wide page layout and

85
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,490
have kept our overall styling
simple, it works.

86
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,350
Finally, be tour guides.

87
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,230
We've constructed the layout and
overall design of the site

88
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,360
with the user in mind, helping
to guide them to the most

89
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,400
important elements on
this page and in

90
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,500
the rest of the site.

91
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:07,880
All right.

92
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,820
So now let's move on
to the markup.

93
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,590
So here's is our header
and our navigation.

94
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:16,420
So previously, in HTML4, we
might have marked this up to

95
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,570
look something like this.

96
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,920
We have our div id="header."
And then, we have

97
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,329
three anchor points.

98
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:23,880
We have our two images,
"better-beer" and

99
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,020
"menu-promo." And then,
we also have our logo.

100
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,280
Now, if we add our navigation,
it would look

101
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,290
something like this.

102
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,320
We have a div id="navigation,"
with an unordered list, with our

103
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,270
navigation elements there.

104
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:39,050
So how might we use our new
HTML5 skills to refactor this

105
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,770
into HTML5.

106
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:45,650
Well, we could move our header
element into a header tag and

107
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,270
we could also move
our navigation

108
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,340
elements into a nav tag.

109
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,870
So all of this is still
valid HTML.

110
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,460
But we've just organized our
markup a little bit better.

111
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,560
So in this case, I've chosen to
give the primary navigation

112
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,150
and the header an ID.

113
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,220
Now, if you remember, in HTML5,
we can use HTML5 tags

114
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,390
in multiple areas on our page.

115
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,630
This is something that you
shouldn't do with IDs.

116
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,440
So if you have a div
id="header," for instance, you

117
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,400
really should only
use that once.

118
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,360
Well, with the HTML5 header
tag, we can use that in

119
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,300
multiple sections of the page.

120
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,595
I know, in our site, we're
going to be using it in

121
00:05:23,595 --> 00:05:24,610
multiple sections.

122
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,040
So I've chosen, in this case,
to give it an ID, to give me

123
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,050
more options and variety
in styling.

124
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,100
Otherwise, our markup
looks exactly the

125
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,840
same as it did before.

126
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,240
So that's our markup for
these two sections.

127
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,760
Now, let's go ahead and
move into style.

128
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,910
So let's review our
elements again.

129
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,610
And we'll start with
the header.

130
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,960
So we have a header with
the ID of main.

131
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,420
And we have two images, Better
Beer and Menu Promo, in

132
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,930
addition to our logo.

133
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,710
So let's start with styling
the two images.

134
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,490
We'll start with Better Beer.

135
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,230
So here are the basic styles
for the Better Beer image.

136
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,820
Now, what we want to do is we
want to create a rollover

137
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,050
state for this image.

138
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,430
So in this case, what we're
going to do is we're going to

139
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,470
use our opacity property
in CSS3.

140
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,800
And we're going to say that our
static image is going to

141
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,780
have an opacity value of 0.65.

142
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,820
Then, when we add our hover
state, we're actually going to

143
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,090
set our opacity value to one.

144
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,770
So what this does is, when we
roll over the image, we're

145
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,590
actually seeing the
full image.

146
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,170
When it's in its static state,
it's actually a little opaque.

147
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:30,310
And you can kind of see how
this renders, here.

148
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,805
Now, this is a neat little
way of doing it.

149
00:06:32,805 --> 00:06:34,770
Because before, we would
have had to save out

150
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,290
two different images.

151
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,790
In this case, we can save out
just one image and adjust the

152
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,280
opacity, using CSS.

153
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,450
Now, let's look at our second
image, menu-promo.

154
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,750
This is going to follow the
same concept as our Better

155
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,720
Beer image.

156
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,480
So here are the basic styles
for menu-promo.

157
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,030
We're going to go ahead and add
an opacity value to the

158
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,240
static state of 0.65.

159
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,750
And we're also going to add an
opacity value of one to our

160
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,830
hover state.

161
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,180
So just like our Better Beer
image, we have a static state

162
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,910
that is a little opaque and when
you roll over it, you're

163
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,085
going to see the full image.

164
00:07:08,085 --> 00:07:11,470
It's a great way of creating
rollovers states with CSS,

165
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,730
with really not a lot
of time involved.

166
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,760
OK, so let's talk
about our logo.

167
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,110
Now, for our logo, we could have
done the same thing as we

168
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,780
did for our previous two images
and just adjust the

169
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,240
opacity values on hover.

170
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,650
But instead, let's get a little
crazy and actually add

171
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,380
a CSS transition to
the hover state.

172
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,470
First, let's look at our basic
styles for our logo.

173
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,180
Now, we're going to add
CSS transitions

174
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,950
to our style sheet.

175
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,140
So here's what the code
would look like.

176
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,010
Now notice we have our vendor
prefixes first, for WebKit,

177
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,580
Mozilla, and Opera, and then,
the basic property following.

178
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,250
Now, let's spend a little bit
of time talking about CSS

179
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,040
transitions.

180
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,570
CSS transitions create smooth
animations using CSS, as

181
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:59,160
opposed to maybe JavaScript,
which is what we would have

182
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,470
used before.

183
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:03,390
Now, CSS transitions have three
properties that we want

184
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,400
to consider.

185
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,070
The first is the transition
property.

186
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,560
Now, the transition property
tells us what piece of the

187
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,360
object is being affected.

188
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,030
So in this case, it's going
to be the opacity.

189
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,380
Now, we could have chosen the
background, or the color, or

190
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,430
another property.

191
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,620
But we'll stick with the
opacity, for this transition.

192
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,530
The second property is the
transition duration.

193
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,370
Now, this tells us how long
the transition lasts.

194
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,600
You can play around with
different values, to get your

195
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,730
desired effect.

196
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:34,070
But in this case, we're going
to go with 0.2 seconds.

197
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,870
Finally, our third transition
property is the

198
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,470
transition-timing function.

199
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,530
And this basically tells
us how we want the

200
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,919
transition to work.

201
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,490
So in this case, we want to use
the ease-in-out property,

202
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:49,930
which is going to give it a
nice intro-outro effect.

203
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,620
Now, there are five
properties for the

204
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,610
transition-timing function.

205
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,900
We have ease, ease-in,
ease-in-out, linear, and

206
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,090
bezier curve.

207
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,290
Now, for the most part, you
probably want to stick with

208
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,250
ease and linear, as those are
the most commonly used.

209
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,040
So now that we have our CSS
transition in place for this

210
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,660
element, we're going to go ahead
and add a hover state,

211
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,400
in which we set the opacity
value to 0.70.

212
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,600
So let's sort of summarize
what we've done in this

213
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,510
transition here.

214
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,440
First, we've created a
transition in which we're

215
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,090
going to affect the opacity.

216
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,520
We're going to do that
for 0.2 seconds.

217
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,500
And we're going to use the
ease-in-out function to give

218
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,870
kind of an intro-outro effect.

219
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,070
And what that's going to do
is, when we hover over the

220
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:37,430
logo, it's going to drop
the opacity to 0.7.

221
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,860
So let's go to the live site.

222
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,530
And I'll show you what
we've built thus far.

223
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:45,200
So for our Better Beer image and
our Menu Promo image, you

224
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,410
can see the opacity rollovers
that we have in place.

225
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:51,100
Pretty neat that we can use just
one image and adjust the

226
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,670
opacity directly with CSS.

227
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,320
And if we take look at the logo,
you can see how it fades

228
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,750
in and out smoothly, courtesy of
the CSS transition that we

229
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,080
just built.

230
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,960
Now let's move on to
the navigation.

231
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,950
So in this navigation,
we have a few things

232
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,310
that need to be styled.

233
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,290
We have a background that
we want to style

234
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,650
with the box shadow.

235
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,000
We have our text, which we
want to style with a text

236
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,200
shadow and actually add an
@font-face declaration.

237
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,580
And then, we're going to
add a transition on

238
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,980
the rollover effect.

239
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,920
So let's start with the
@font-face declaration.

240
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,560
So the first thing we're going
to do is add our @font-face

241
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,600
declaration to the top
of our style sheet.

242
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,300
Now, if you remember, we can
hit up the website Font

243
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,020
Squirrel, which will generate
the CSS that we need to set

244
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,620
this @font-face property.

245
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,590
And in doing that, we'll
get code that looks

246
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,170
something like this.

247
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,910
Now, notice we're using
DroidSansBold for our

248
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,910
navigation.

249
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:46,110
Once we have that, we'll go
into our CSS and continue

250
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,500
styling out the main
navigation section.

251
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,250
So if you remember in our
markup, we had a nav with an

252
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,650
ID of primary.

253
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,340
So here we have the hatch
primary elements.

254
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,720
Now, you'll notice that I've
already put the DroidSansBold

255
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,630
font in my font stack.

256
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,120
Remember, we've declared that
already, in an @font-face

257
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,100
property at the top of
our style sheet.

258
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,380
So now we're calling that
font, in our font stack.

259
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,730
Now we're going to add a box
shadow to the background of

260
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,160
our navigation element.

261
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,720
So here's what the code might
look like for that.

262
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,790
Now, notice we have our vendor
prefixes first, WebKit

263
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,440
box-shadow and Mozilla
box-shadow, in addition to our

264
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,390
regular box-shadow property.

265
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,550
And remember, our values are
x-offset, y-offset, and then

266
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,540
blur, in addition to
our color value.

267
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,640
And then, we put that above
our font stack, which

268
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,440
remember, includes our
DroidSansBold font that we

269
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,060
declared with an @font-face.

270
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,640
Now that's done, let's
go ahead and start

271
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,655
styling out our text.

272
00:11:40,655 --> 00:11:43,000
So here are the basic
styles for that.

273
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,880
Now notice, we've added
a text-shadow.

274
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,240
And just like box-shadow, we
have our values, x-offset,

275
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,230
y-offset, blur, and color.

276
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:54,390
So in this case, we have a dark
text color on a light

277
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:54,920
background.

278
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,440
So remember, we're going to do
a text-shadow that is offset

279
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,460
bottom-right, with
a light color.

280
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,780
Because we want to give it that
letter-pressed effect,

281
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,510
like it's being stamped
into the background.

282
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,950
We also want to define
a border-radius

283
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,230
for our hover state.

284
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,880
Because who wants just boring
rectangles in the background?

285
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,660
Why not round those corners?

286
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,040
So in this case, we've added our
vendor prefixes first, for

287
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,650
our border-radius property.

288
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,730
And we've defined our radius
to be five pixels.

289
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,600
Here's how that might render.

290
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,590
Finally, we're going to add a
CSS transition to this, to

291
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,710
really tie everything
together.

292
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,220
So in this case, we're
going to do our

293
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,650
vendor prefixes first.

294
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,360
Remember to include Opera.

295
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,900
And then, we have our
basic transition

296
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,300
property at the bottom.

297
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,160
Now remember, in our case
previous transition example,

298
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,280
we just used the property
opacity, when we're talking

299
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,390
about what portion of the
object we want to be

300
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,440
transitioned.

301
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,850
In this case, we want everything
to be included in

302
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,850
the transition.

303
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,542
So we're going to use the
transition property all.

304
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:54,650
We're going to set the
time function at 0.3.

305
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,620
And then, we're also going to
use our ease-in-out function,

306
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,580
just like we did in our last
transition property.

307
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,850
So let's go ahead and take
a look at the live site.

308
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,520
And I'll show you what
the navigation looks

309
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,840
like in real time.

310
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,510
So we have our navigation
section with a box-shadow on

311
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,540
our background.

312
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,560
And you can see how
our DroidSansBold

313
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,360
text renders properly.

314
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,940
Let's check out the rollovers.

315
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,570
As you can see, we changed
the color of the text.

316
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,380
Now you can see the
text-shadow.

317
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,470
And we also have our
smooth transition.

318
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,340
To me, it's much better than
just a simple hover state.

319
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,700
It's a small detail.

320
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,000
But I really think it adds
a lot to this section.

321
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,350
Now that we've gone over how to
craft effective header and

322
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,770
navigation elements.

323
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,270
It's time for you to
apply what you've

324
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,590
learned in this level.

325
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,840
Let's start coding.
