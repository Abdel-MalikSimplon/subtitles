1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:02,820
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,680
In this section, we
will be exploring

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,560
functionality inside of objects.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,070
So here, we're going to start
with an aquarium object -

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,950
we are in the Ocean of Objects,
after all - an aquarium object

6
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,950
filled with other objects.

7
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,290
And let's first build some
add and remove functionality

8
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,580
for our aquarium.

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,310
Inside our aquarium, you can see
we have some fish, a star fish,

10
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,970
as well a couple toys, a coral
castle and the dragon statue.

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,330
Our aquarium looks pretty good.

12
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,420
But what if we wanted
to add some creatures?

13
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,060
Well, we can build a
function called addCritter.

14
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,570
And in that, we would pass
a container - in this case,

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,945
we're probably going to be
passing the aquarium-- as well

16
00:00:41,945 --> 00:00:45,800
as the name of our creature,
the type, the species,

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,570
and the length.

18
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,940
We can also create
an add Toy function.

19
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,720
This one would get the
container, the name, the type,

20
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,990
the material, as well as
whether it moves or not.

21
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,990
To add a creature
to our container,

22
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,910
we would do container
bracket name

23
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,750
and assign to it
a brand new object

24
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,950
literal where we pass
the parameters into each

25
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,940
of the properties
for that object.

26
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,340
Now wouldn't it be nice if
these functions actually

27
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,180
belonged to the aquarium
instead of being

28
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,210
external to the aquarium itself.

29
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,860
Let's try adding one
of these functions

30
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,810
to our aquarium object.

31
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,640
Important thing about objects
is that properties can also

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,890
be functions.

33
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,892
That's going to allow us to
add our add Critter function in.

34
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:34,850
Something to be aware of
is that you will often

35
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,550
hear an object's
function properties being

36
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,540
referred to as its methods.

37
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,800
So to add a new property
that holds a function,

38
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,030
we would just create an
add Critter property, much

39
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,640
like we would create
other properties.

40
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,480
And then inside of it, we would
build an anonymous function.

41
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,970
Now something to really
pay attention to here

42
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:59,180
is that our container
parameter has disappeared.

43
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,820
And that's because we're
making the function belong

44
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,880
to that very container.

45
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,230
We're going to use
a special syntax now

46
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,250
that refers to the
aquarium object.

47
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,210
Now, the this
keyword will always

48
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:17,620
refer to the owner object of the
function in which the this is

49
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,110
used.

50
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,690
So in this case, when
called, add Critter

51
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,830
will say, "Hey, aquarium -
that's what the this does -

52
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,820
make a new property
with this name - that's

53
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,550
the one in the bracket -
and then assign to it

54
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,450
an object with these
particular properties.

55
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,120
Sweet.

56
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,260
We've got a property
that holds a function.

57
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,080
Awesome.

58
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,611
And now, it's available as
a property on the aquarium

59
00:02:46,611 --> 00:02:47,110
objects.

60
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,250
So let's go ahead
and add a creature.

61
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,820
Let's add a yellow
tang called "Bubbles."

62
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,790
If we pass in the name Bubbles,
which we know is a fish

63
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,350
and the kind of fish is
a Yellow Tang species.

64
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,650
And its length is 5.6.

65
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,920
We just call the function
just like referencing

66
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,610
any other property in aquarium.

67
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,240
But in this one, we put up a set
of parentheses for parameters

68
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,467
and pass in the information.

69
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:14,425
And here comes Bubbles.

70
00:03:14,425 --> 00:03:16,050
He drops into the aquarium.

71
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:21,250
And we have all of Bubbles'
properties set correctly.

72
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,040
Hmm.

73
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,830
Well, our tank's
looking a little full

74
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,600
so let's try to build
another method that

75
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,540
will be able to remove any of
the objects from our aquarium.

76
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,060
And since you already
know how to build

77
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,920
a function inside the object
literal with a property,

78
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,280
let's now try to build
a function on the fly.

79
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,510
And we can do that with the
dot operator and a function

80
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,630
expression.

81
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,540
All we will need here, to
delete any property whether it's

82
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:51,890
a fish or a toy or even
a function, is its name.

83
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,060
What we'll need here
is a temp variable

84
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,435
that will help us hold onto
the object that we remove.

85
00:03:57,435 --> 00:03:58,810
So what we're
doing here is we're

86
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,890
saying, create this temp
variable and assign to it

87
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,904
a reference to the object
that this name points to.

88
00:04:06,904 --> 00:04:07,820
Why are we doing this?

89
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,780
Because we still
want to have access

90
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,720
to the object outside
of the aquarium.

91
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,799
We don't want it to float
off into code oblivion.

92
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,340
We want to be able
to use it or maybe

93
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,829
place it on the table
or something like that.

94
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:22,530
Next, we will remove the actual
property from the aquarium.

95
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,970
That's with the delete keyword.

96
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,270
Finally, we'll return
the temp variable

97
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,890
so that we can still
have a reference

98
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,280
to that removed object once
the take Out method is finished.

99
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,694
Let's test our take Out method.

100
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,360
So we'll get a variable
established here

101
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,080
called fish Out Of Water.

102
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,340
And we'll take out a fish.

103
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,548
Who are we going to take out?

104
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:43,980
We'll take out Marlin.

105
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,730
What happens is that Marlin's
entire property is completely

106
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,040
eliminated.

107
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,550
And Marlin gets established
inside the fish Out Of Water

108
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,870
variable now.

109
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,460
If we were to log out the
fish Out Of Water variable,

110
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,080
we can see that the entire
fish object of Marlon

111
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,890
is still available.

112
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,580
But wait a second.

113
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,270
That kind of sucks because
we lost Marlin's name.

114
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,390
So let's see if we
can fix that problem

115
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:13,690
with some clever
property trickery.

116
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,890
We're going to add an extra
line to our take Out method.

117
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,390
This is going to make sure
that we get Marlin's name

118
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:23,120
when we remove him
from the aquarium.

119
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,170
Don't let this frighten you.

120
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,020
But stay very close on it.

121
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,800
The first name in
this line of code

122
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,250
will find the desired
object in the aquarium

123
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,400
and using the parameter
name as the property name.

124
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,680
So this bracket name is
finding, inside the aquarium,

125
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,380
the object we're looking for.

126
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,780
Then we use a dot.

127
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,190
And that second name will
create a new property

128
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,480
inside the object that
we want to remove.

129
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,890
This is kind of cool.

130
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,760
Notice though that
that dot name is not

131
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,220
the same name as the
function's parameter.

132
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,080
That's very important.

133
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,270
This third name, however,
is the function's parameter.

134
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,730
It assigns the old property
name, which we already

135
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,440
know is Marlin, to
the newly created name

136
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,130
property in the removed object.

137
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,600
How sneaky and cool is that?

138
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,460
We love it.

139
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,990
Now, when we take
Marlin out, and then we

140
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,240
log out his variable, on
the back end of our object,

141
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,710
we see a new property
name called name.

142
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,540
And Marlin's name is there.

143
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,875
Woohoo, no identity crisis.

144
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:26,375
Fantastic.

145
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:31,460
Now the cool thing
about our take Out method

146
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,760
is that it will
take out any object.

147
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,690
We could delete even
our dragon statue.

148
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:37,630
So let's try that.

149
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,510
We'll establish a
variable called toy

150
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,460
and go ahead and take
out the dragon statue.

151
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,090
It shows up inside
the toy variable.

152
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,140
And when we log out the
toy, this time, we can see,

153
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,440
not only has the toy been
taken out of the aquarium,

154
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,610
but look at the back end.

155
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,205
You can see the name was
saved, dragon statue.

156
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,400
So now you know how
to add and manipulate

157
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,589
functions inside of objects.

158
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,630
And we're going to give
you a few challenges that

159
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,434
do just that.

160
00:07:06,434 --> 00:07:07,350
I hope you enjoy them.

161
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,940
We'll see you back
in the next section.
