00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,114
Welcome back.

2
00:00:03,114 --> 00:00:04,780
In this section, we're
going to continue

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,670
adding content to our email.

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,650
We're going to use conditional
content to add a button that

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,680
will work in multiple clients.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,650
Typically, the way that
we would add a button

7
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,970
is we would add an anchor
tag and apply styles to it.

8
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,650
This would work in
any clients that

9
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,220
use browser-based rendering
engines, but as we've learned,

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,140
these styles would not apply
to the Word rendering engine.

11
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,040
What we need is a way to write
code that Microsoft Word would

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,640
apply these styles.

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,880
If you're interested in
learning that language,

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,780
you can look forward to
our future course, Try VML.

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,830
Of course, I'm kidding.

16
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,390
We would never
create that course,

17
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,490
and no one really wants
to write this code,

18
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,900
so we're going to do
that in a different way.

19
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,750
Luckily, there's an
excellent resource

20
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,170
on the web created by Stig
at Campaign Monitor called

21
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,210
buttons.cm.

22
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,040
This allows us to create a
button using a GUI to enter

23
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,710
values, and outputs two
versions of a button —

24
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,660
one that would use VML and HTML
that will render in the Word

25
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,920
rendering engine, and
one using just HTML

26
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,360
that would render in all
other rendering engines.

27
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,640
Our first step would be to take
the code from the generator

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,320
and put it into a table
cell in our email.

29
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,670
Once that code is in,
we can test and see

30
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,510
that we have a
consistent experience

31
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,790
across multiple clients.

32
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,460
While we do have a
consistent experience,

33
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,900
it doesn't match our design
exactly how we want it to,

34
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,220
so we're going to need
to update the code.

35
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,960
The first area that
we're going to update

36
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,360
is the center tag
within the VML tag.

37
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,150
We're going to add our font that
we want on the button of Arial.

38
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,280
We're going to up the
font size to 20 pixels,

39
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,270
and then add in our text
transform uppercase.

40
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,810
The interesting
thing about this is

41
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,210
that, if you now test
in multiple clients,

42
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,430
you would only see these
changes in clients using

43
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,300
Word as a rendering engine.

44
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,390
This is because
the VML is wrapped

45
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,419
in a conditional tag that
is targeting specifically

46
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,314
Microsoft Outlook.

47
00:02:11,816 --> 00:02:14,190
Updating the style of our
button in the remaining clients

48
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,940
is as easy as editing our HTML.

49
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,020
The one interesting thing to
note is the reason that these

50
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,180
styles get hidden from Microsoft
Word is the special vendor

51
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:31,390
property mso-hide:all;.

52
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,880
Taking a look at our
email in multiple clients,

53
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,190
we now see that we have
a button that works well

54
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,210
in Outlook using Internet
Explorer and Outlook using

55
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,440
Microsoft Word.

56
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,740
Now it's your turn to use
VML and HTML to create

57
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,720
a bulletproof button
in the challenges.
