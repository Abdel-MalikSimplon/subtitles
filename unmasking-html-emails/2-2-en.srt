1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,520
Welcome back to level two.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,520
Now that we've recreated our
header using tables for layout,

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,350
we're going to continue building
out the content of our email

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:14,620
using multiple tables and
nested tables to create columns.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,800
It's important to know that each
section should use a new table.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,890
We used one table
for our header.

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,850
Now we're going to
add another table

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,240
to hold the image
of our luchadores,

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,950
and then create a third table,
with two nested tables inside

10
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,810
of it, one each for
each content area.

11
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,100
Here, you can see that we
have our wrapper table,

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,890
our header content
table, and we're

13
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,060
adding a table right below
that to contain our image.

14
00:00:51,194 --> 00:00:53,110
If we wanted to create
space between our image

15
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,570
and our header, we would
normally use margin.

16
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,480
However, we get varied results
in clients when using margin,

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,550
and outlook.com specifically
doesn't support it.

18
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,730
Instead of relying on
margin to create space

19
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,780
in between the two tables,
we're going to use padding.

20
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,350
Here, we're going to add
padding to the cell that

21
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,410
is containing our image.

22
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,020
Next, we want to
create a table that's

23
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,410
going to have two columns.

24
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,600
Up until this point,
we've used a single cell

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,990
to contain our content.

26
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,200
However, we can
use multiple cells

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,970
and rely on the default behavior
for them to align side by side.

28
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,850
Knowing that we want
each area of content

29
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,900
to have its own
table, we're now going

30
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,010
to put a table inside the
first cell of our new table.

31
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,435
This new table is where
we'll apply our styles.

32
00:01:48,294 --> 00:01:49,710
For our second
column, we're going

33
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,790
to repeat this same process,
adding another table

34
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,990
within the second cell, and
using that table to style

35
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,550
the content in
the second column.

36
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,960
To ensure that we have
an exact amount of space

37
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,660
in between our
two columns, we're

38
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,360
going to use padding on
the two-column cells.

39
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,604
On the first one, we're going to
add padding right of 10 pixels,

40
00:02:12,604 --> 00:02:14,020
and on the second
one, we're going

41
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,650
to add padding
left of 10 pixels.

42
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,830
This creates a total
of 20 pixels space

43
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,955
in between the two columns.

44
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,840
Styling the content for column
one is a review of the things

45
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,470
that we have already done.

46
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,030
The first and last rows
each contain a cell

47
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,310
with an image for our border.

48
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:40,430
The second row
contains our date,

49
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,310
and the third row
contains our month.

50
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,440
For the first half of
content in column two,

51
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,670
we're using the same
approach that we just saw.

52
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,670
Moving further
into the table, we

53
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:07,660
have a row with a cell that
has multiple font styles.

54
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,920
In order to do this,
we need to wrap a span

55
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,724
around each area of text that we
want to be styled differently.

56
00:03:13,724 --> 00:03:15,140
Here, you can see
that we're using

57
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,370
two spans to apply
different font families

58
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,465
and different font sizes.

59
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,250
All of our hard
work has paid off.

60
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,700
Here, you can see that our
layout looks great in Outlook

61
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,340
using IE and Outlook using Word.

62
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,900
Now it's your turn to go
back into the challenges

63
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,160
and create multiple
columns using tables.

64
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,292
And le-- Ugh.

65
00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:43,530
Heh.

66
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,330
Oh, I was so close.

67
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,600
With that "Uh-tribute."
now our table is centered.

68
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,450
Ah, da--
