00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:02,734
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,734 --> 00:00:04,400
In this section, we're
going to complete

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,360
the content of our email and
correct some problems that

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,922
sneak in along the way.

5
00:00:09,922 --> 00:00:11,630
While you were completing
the challenges,

6
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,130
we added some new content.

7
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,810
We've added a phone number,
an unsubscribe link,

8
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,930
and some contact information.

9
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,680
To do this, we created a
new table with three rows,

10
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,240
with one cell each for
each bit of content.

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,910
In looking at the code that
we wrote for the phone number,

12
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,340
we added this as plain text.

13
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,710
However, if we test
it in Apple Mail,

14
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,190
we're surprised to see
that it's now a link.

15
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,490
What's happening here
is Apple's preprocessor

16
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,320
adds HTML to convert
that text into a link.

17
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,399
Now we have a link
in our email, but it

18
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:44,440
doesn't match our design.

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,630
We don't have access to the
HTML that created the link,

20
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,140
but Apple Mail does support
CSS in the style tag,

21
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,960
so we can target all anchor
tags and apply a color to them.

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,380
Now that we see this,
we're thinking maybe

23
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,280
it would be better if
this text was white.

24
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,680
We still don't have
access to the HTML

25
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,060
that created this link, but we
know where it's going to be,

26
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,670
so to counter this behavior, we
can wrap the phone number text

27
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,030
in a span and then
use that class

28
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,760
to give that text
a specific style.

29
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,440
Now we can see that
our phone number

30
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,360
link has changed to white, while
the unsubscribe link remained

31
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,070
purple.

32
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,480
This is exactly what we wanted.

33
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,450
Sometimes you want to set font
size smaller than 14 pixels.

34
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,440
Unfortunately, some
clients won't allow this.

35
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,970
To show an example of this,
we have set our font size

36
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,480
to four pixels.

37
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,690
If we were to view this email
in Gmail using Chrome,

38
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,860
we would see that it's rendering
the text at four pixels.

39
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,060
However, if we look
at it in Apple Mail,

40
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,625
we can see that it's not, and
it's adjusted it to 14 pixels.

41
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,340
There are vendor-specific
properties

42
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,560
that exist to override
these defaults.

43
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,360
WebKit and Microsoft allow
a text size adjustment

44
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,820
to none, that would
make it so our text will

45
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,332
render at the specific
pixel value that we set.

46
00:02:15,332 --> 00:02:16,790
With this property
in place, we can

47
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,650
see that Apple Mail will
now render our footer

48
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,910
text at four pixels.

49
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,401
If we look at our email
in Gmail using Chrome,

50
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:30,900
we can see that there was no
link added to the phone number,

51
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,020
and our font sizes are
the way that we want them.

52
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,570
If we then look at
it in Apple Mail,

53
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,500
we see that we do have our
link, with our white color

54
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,160
and our smaller text size.

55
00:02:44,277 --> 00:02:45,860
Now it's your turn
to tackle some edge

56
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,080
cases in the challenges.

57
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,980
Take that, slide.

58
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,735
Go to your home.

59
00:02:52,735 --> 00:02:53,964
What is he talking about?

60
00:02:53,964 --> 00:02:54,870
Where —

61
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,790
In this section,
we're going to — ooh.

62
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,340
Hey.
