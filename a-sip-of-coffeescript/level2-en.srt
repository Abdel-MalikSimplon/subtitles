1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,944
They call it CoffeeScript.

2
00:00:02,944 --> 00:00:04,408
Come by and take a sip.

3
00:00:04,408 --> 00:00:06,360
I know it's quite a trip.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:12,216
But somehow you can write less
code to get more done.

5
00:00:12,216 --> 00:00:12,704
Yeah.

6
00:00:12,704 --> 00:00:16,422
Come on and take a seat,
don't end up obsolete.

7
00:00:16,422 --> 00:00:18,777
They call it CoffeeScript.

8
00:00:18,777 --> 00:00:20,190
CoffeeScript, yeah.

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,640
Welcome to the second level of
"A Sip of CoffeeScript." In

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,520
this level, we're not going
to be learning any new

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,250
CoffeeScript concepts.

12
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,220
We're simply going to be
applying them and practicing

13
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,910
them using some jQuery.

14
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,270
If you played through the
jQuery Air Captain's Log

15
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,230
course, some of this should
look familiar.

16
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,090
We're going to take some jQuery
from there and convert

17
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,910
it to CoffeeScript.

18
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,730
You'll remember, if you played
jQuery Air Captain's Log, that

19
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,520
we had this flight selector you
see down here with a bunch

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,330
of different tabs.

21
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,960
And we could select a tab, and
it would become active.

22
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,540
The code that we wrote looked
something like this.

23
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,800
Here, we have the
jQuery wrapper.

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,260
On the click event for one of
these tabs called the Change

25
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,140
Tab Function, here is the Change
Tab Function where we

26
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,190
call Prevent Default.

27
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,550
Then we remove the active class
from the one that's

28
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:11,720
currently active.

29
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,040
And we add the active class
to the clicked tab.

30
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,200
Let's start converting this line
by line to CoffeeScript.

31
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,000
Often in CoffeeScript code
you'll see people just use

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,510
Dollar Sign, Arrow.

33
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:27,110
And that's fine to do as long as
jQuery is the only library

34
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,890
in your application that's
using that dollar sign.

35
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:30,870
Let's use that in our code.

36
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,310
Let's move that up.

37
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,280
Next is the function
definition.

38
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,620
We can define Change Tab.

39
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,450
For most of the remaining lines,
all we really have to

40
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,690
do is remove the semicolons
and curly brackets.

41
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,750
Let's do that.

42
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,810
Our code is looking nicer.

43
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,760
We can also optionally remove
the parentheses from some of

44
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,920
those function calls.

45
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,640
Let's go ahead and do that.

46
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,330
There's one last thing we
can do this code to

47
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,460
make it look nice.

48
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,030
You see that "this"
word in there?

49
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,580
Well, in CoffeeScript we have
a shortcut for this.

50
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,660
We can simply use the @ sign.

51
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:06,000
So, I could write this
line like this.

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,990
Now, let's take a look at
the JavaScript and the

53
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,430
CoffeeScript we wrote
side by side.

54
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,370
Feel free to pause the video at
this point if you want to

55
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,520
take a closer look and really
examine the differences.

56
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,450
Let's convert a couple more
snippets of JavaScript to

57
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,210
CoffeeScript.

58
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,390
Here you can see we have
a click handler.

59
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,040
To convert that to CoffeeScript,
it would look

60
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,770
something like this.

61
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,570
Here's some JavaScript
where we use a queue.

62
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,770
Let's convert this
to CoffeeScript.

63
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:37,270
It would look something
like this.

64
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,270
Before you jump into the
challenges, let's take a look

65
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,650
at one more example.

66
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,670
Here's some JavaScript
from jQuery Air.

67
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,730
Let's convert this
line by line.

68
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:46,270
So

69
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:50,080
First line, here is the
function definition.

70
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,850
Next line, we declare the
num_flights variable.

71
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:56,920
You notice I'm using the @
symbol instead of this.

72
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,800
Next line, we have
(this).append.

73
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,550
Again, I'm using
the @ symbol.

74
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,250
You'll notice here we're using
an interpolated string.

75
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,450
And the last line is
pretty obvious.

76
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,130
It's basically the same thing
without the semicolon.

77
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,810
And that about wraps up
the second level.

78
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,000
I know it was pretty short.

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,360
But I want to get you more
familiar with using this new

80
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,090
CoffeeScript syntax.

81
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,830
In the challenges, you're going
to write some jQuery and

82
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,220
convert it from JavaScript
to CoffeeScript.
