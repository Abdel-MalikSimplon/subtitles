1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,330
[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,408
They call it CoffeeScript,
come by and take a sip.

3
00:00:04,408 --> 00:00:07,336
I know it's quite trip but
somehow you can write less

4
00:00:07,336 --> 00:00:12,704
code to get more done.

5
00:00:12,704 --> 00:00:13,192
Yeah!

6
00:00:13,192 --> 00:00:15,952
Come on and take a seat,
don't end up obsolete.

7
00:00:15,952 --> 00:00:17,840
They call it CoffeeScript.

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,256
CoffeeScript, yeah.

9
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,180
Hey look, you made it all
the way to level six.

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,520
In level six, we're going to
be talking about object

11
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,970
orientation, stuff with classes
and how to apply that

12
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,290
and all the cool new mechanisms
that CoffeeScript

13
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,660
gives you to do object
orientation.

14
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,090
So let's dive into it.

15
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,685
Remember this object?

16
00:00:39,685 --> 00:00:41,570
We played around with
this a little bit.

17
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,110
We have our coffee object.

18
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,180
Well, what would happen if we
wanted to, instead of having

19
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,340
it as an object, create
it as a class?

20
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,220
Let's give that a try.

21
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,520
So here we have our
Coffee class.

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,020
It has a constructor.

23
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,780
That constructor is called
when it's instantiated.

24
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,010
We can't call it explicitly.

25
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,800
I'll show you how to instantiate
it in a minute.

26
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,360
And then we have these
parameters we sent in, which

27
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,260
we're going to set as properties
on the class.

28
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,440
Some people might think of these
as instance variables

29
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,020
because they're properties of
the instance of that class.

30
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,030
Another way we can write this
constructor is simply by using

31
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,310
this one line you see here.

32
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,180
So the parameters with the
@ symbol basically

33
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,370
does the same thing.

34
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,550
It's just a shortcut.

35
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,670
If we want to have functions
inside of our class, it looks

36
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,910
pretty much the same as they did
when we had them inside of

37
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,640
our object.

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,260
Pretty much the same thing.

39
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,400
Now if we wanted to instantiate
this coffee

40
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,730
object, we're going to just call
it French coffee with the

41
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,510
strength of two, we can do
something like this.

42
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:48,130
Then if we call french.brew,
it's gonna pop up an alert

43
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,680
that looks like this.

44
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,000
But how do we do inheritance
in CoffeeScript?

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,350
What if we have a coffee class
like this and we want to have

46
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,600
a category, a type
of coffee that's

47
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,510
under a certain category?

48
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,600
We might, for instance,
have class

49
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,199
MaxgoodHouse extends Coffee.

50
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,930
And if we just instantiated
MaxgoodHouse, it would work

51
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,440
just like the Coffee class.

52
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,860
We can also override the
constructor if we want to.

53
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,230
So in this case, the default
strength is going to be zero.

54
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,640
And we can also add properties
at this point.

55
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,890
So we can have brand =
"Maxgood House"

56
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,600
At this point, we can
instantiate that class, and if

57
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,310
we run boring.brew, we're going
to get back "Brewing

58
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:37,260
boring." We can also override
functions in our parent class

59
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,620
just by declaring
them, like so.

60
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,430
So in this case, if I
instantiate this object and

61
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,430
call brew, it's going to print
"Brewing Maxgood House

62
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,280
Boring." Another thing that we
can do when we're overriding

63
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,190
functions--

64
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,050
if we want to call the function
from the parent

65
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,790
class, we can use the
keyword super.

66
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,490
So in this case, we're calling
#"{super(amount)}, but it sucks,"

67
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,700
and then when we call that pour
function, it's going to

68
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,890
print out, "Pouring a single cup
but it sucks." We're going

69
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,560
to want to use this
Coffee class from

70
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,280
inside of our jQuery.

71
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,460
So let's put some jQuery
in here with

72
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,200
the pourClick function.

73
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,980
So we're going to watch
for a click event.

74
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,710
If inventory isn't zero, take
away one, and then alert that

75
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,290
we poured a cup of coffee.

76
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,340
But this isn't going to work.

77
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:24,900
Why?

78
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,140
Well, it's because of this.

79
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,220
So we have that @
symbol in there.

80
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,470
So it's going to be calling
this dot from inside a

81
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,560
different context.

82
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,660
So basically, it's going to
error out because it's going

83
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,040
to be looking for the property
of the dom element called

84
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,320
@inventory and @name,
which isn't good.

85
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,640
We want this to refer
to our class.

86
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,240
To fix this, we need
to use something

87
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,770
called the fat arrow.

88
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,560
What the fat arrow is going to
do is bind to the current

89
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,110
value of "this," so no matter
what context this code is run,

90
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,770
it's always going to be
referring to the Coffee class.

91
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,120
We're going to go through one
more jQuery Air Captain's Log

92
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,930
example before we're all done.

93
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,030
In jQuery Air Captain's Log,
we used an object to

94
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,470
encapsulate some code and
keep it organized.

95
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,040
Let's take a look at the code.

96
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,520
So here we have selectFlights,
we have a property inside of

97
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,180
there, an init function.

98
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,540
We're going to bind
a click event.

99
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,930
We're going to bind another
click event-- this time

100
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,010
calling it a different way.

101
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,630
Show the flights.

102
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,460
At the bottom, we have
two extra functions.

103
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,560
I'm not going to bother
showing you what those

104
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,790
definitions are.

105
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:37,230
Let's try converting this into
a CoffeeScript class.

106
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,130
So up at the top, we're
going to have a

107
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,240
SelectFlights class.

108
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,350
That SelectFlights class is
going to have a constructor

109
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,740
for the fetchingFlights
property.

110
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,020
Next, we have bind function.

111
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,850
That's pretty simple.

112
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,430
We just need to get rid
of the parentheses

113
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,810
in the curly brackets.

114
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:56,940
Now we have another
click event.

115
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,510
We're just calling
it differently.

116
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,140
And here, we're just pretty much
going to get rid of the

117
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,130
curly braces, the parentheses,
and use the @

118
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,140
instead of the this.

119
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,950
Also notice that we're using the
fat arrow here, instead of

120
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:14,095
the skinny arrow, so we can
bind that @ symbol or the

121
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:17,100
this to the correct context
inside of our

122
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,280
SelectFlights class.

123
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,390
Lastly, we have our two
functions, showFlights and

124
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,600
changeTab.

125
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,890
Notice that it's only the second
one that we have the

126
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,880
fat arrow on.

127
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,800
Once we've declared the class,
we need to instantiate it so

128
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,360
that it binds to the
proper events.

129
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,720
Well, you made to the end of
the final video in A Sip of

130
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,950
CoffeeScript.

131
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,680
From here, just got to do the
last couple challenges to

132
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,530
unlock a badge, some prizes,
and the final video.
