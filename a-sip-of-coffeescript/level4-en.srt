1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,330


2
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,456
(SINGING) They call
it CoffeeScript.

3
00:00:02,456 --> 00:00:04,408
Come by and take a sip.

4
00:00:04,408 --> 00:00:08,312
I know it's quite a trip, but
somehow you can write less

5
00:00:08,312 --> 00:00:12,216
code to get more done.

6
00:00:12,216 --> 00:00:12,704
Yeah!

7
00:00:12,704 --> 00:00:14,190
Come on and take a seat.

8
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,967
Don't end up obsolete.

9
00:00:15,967 --> 00:00:17,428
We call it CoffeeScript.

10
00:00:17,428 --> 00:00:22,460


11
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,650
All right, you're halfway
done with the course.

12
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,810
Now, we're onto level four.

13
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,580
We're going to be talking
about arrays,

14
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,880
objects, and iteration.

15
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,380
So in CoffeeScript, we have
these things called ranges.

16
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,530
So we can say range
range = [1..4]

17
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,000
And that's going to translate
into the JavaScript of just

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,750
one, two, three, four
in an array.

19
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,570
We can also say range = [1...4]

20
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,960
So that's three dots, which is
going to give us an array with

21
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,260
everything but the last item.

22
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,440
So it's just going to be one,
two, three in JavaScript.

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,470
This may not seem
very powerful.

24
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,020
Where it starts to get more
powerful is when you realize

25
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,840
that you can use it with
variables and to get subsets

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,370
of existing arrays.

27
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,190
So here we have two variables,
and we have a

28
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,550
start and an end.

29
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,720
So it's going to create
an array with 5, 6,

30
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,660
7, 8, 9, and 10.

31
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,647
Then we can get a subset of that
array by just doing one

32
00:01:16,647 --> 00:01:16,880
dot dot four.

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,250
And that's going to return six,
seven, eight, and nine.

34
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,290
We could get a range from
one with three dots to

35
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,350
range.length.

36
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,880
So we would get from
the second item to

37
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,290
the end of the array.

38
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,150
We could also write this with
just range = [1..-1]

39
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,330


40
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:35,180
So when we do negative 1, it
will wrap around from the

41
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,190
front to the very last item.

42
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,710


43
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,280
To create a basic array in
CoffeeScript, you can either

44
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,150
do the normal sort of array
syntax you see here.

45
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,770
But you can also take out
the commas if you

46
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,280
use the proper spacing.

47
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,680
So here you can see we have
storeLocations, Orlando,

48
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,800
Winter Park, and Sanford,
just like that.

49
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,880
Now, let's talk a little bit
about looping through the

50
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,360
array we just created.

51
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,300
So we can obviously just
do a forEach loop.

52
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,510
That's going to translate
from CoffeeScript into

53
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,530
JavaScript like so.

54
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,690
Pretty basic, nothing
amazing there.

55
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:13,580
However, it's much more common
in CoffeeScript to not do a

56
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,800
forEach and do something
that looks a little

57
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,390
bit more like this.

58
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,940
We have for location
in storeLocations.

59
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,480
So it's going to go through each
of the items in the store

60
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,380
locations array, set it equal
to location every time it

61
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,840
iterates through the loop, and
then call alert on it.

62
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,990
So we should have three
different alerts.

63
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,640
If we wanted to, we could also
move this for loop to the end

64
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,310
of the line.

65
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,730
So we could say alert location
for location in

66
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,000
storeLocations.

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,910
There's another word for this.

68
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,360
It's called a list
comprehension.

69
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,220
Let's take a look at a couple
more list comprehensions.

70
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,000
So what if we wanted to add
", FL" for each of those

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,470
cities in our array?

72
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,420
Well, we could write
it like this.

73
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,360
So we have our interpolated
string for location in

74
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,240
storeLocations, and that
would be the array that

75
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,670
it returns for us.

76
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,970
If we wanted to overwrite our
original array, we want to

77
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,030
write it like this.

78
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,490
The parentheses here are
really important.

79
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,500
Keep that in mind.

80
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,360
If we didn't have the
parentheses around the list

81
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,080
comprehension, it would set
storeLocation equal to

82
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,900
Orlando, then Winter
Park, then Sanford.

83
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,920
So the result would be
storeLocations equals Sanford.

84
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,160
But because we have the
parentheses there, it's going

85
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,750
to build the array and then
send that array into the

86
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,380
variable we declared.

87
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,700
Another list comprehension
example, if we wanted to call

88
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,530
the geoLocate function on each
of our storeLocations except

89
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,390
for the Sanford location, we
could say for location in

90
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,920
storeLocations when location
isn't Sanford.

91
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,530
That's called a filter, and
you can put any sort of

92
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,040
expression after a filter.

93
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,740
What if we wanted to create a
new array, a brand new array,

94
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,910
without Sanford?

95
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,330
How would we do that?

96
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,360
Well, one way we could do that
is like this, basically

97
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,990
reiterating through each item,
push that onto our brand new

98
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,430
array, and we would have a new
array without Sanford.

99
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,720
However, let's use a
list comprehension.

100
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,840
So we could also do this by
doing location for location in

101
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,020
storeLocations when location
isn't Sanford.

102
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,320
Now, I know this may look
a little bit confusing.

103
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,370
Feel free to pause the video
and let it absorb.

104
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,240
But all this is saying is
return location for each

105
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,280
location where location
isn't Sanford.

106
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,860
So it's going to return an array
that doesn't include the

107
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,580
Sanford location.

108
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,510
Next up, let's talk about using
splats in CoffeeScript.

109
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,210
It's a fun name, and we use it
for when we want to have a

110
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,790
variable number of parameters
sent into a function, or send

111
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,550
a variable number of parameters
into a function.

112
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,160
Let me explain.

113
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,070
So here we have a function
called searchLocations.

114
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,260
You can see we have the dot
dot dot in the parameters.

115
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,380
Now, we can call that function
using two parameters.

116
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,110
We would get this returned.

117
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,700
We can also call this function
using three parameters or four

118
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,300
parameters or five parameters.

119
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,660
You can see here that it's
basically taking whatever

120
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,330
parameters are after the first
one and combining them into an

121
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:08,220
array, which we are then joining
inside of that string.

122
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,800
Not only can splats be used in
the definition of a function,

123
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,120
but you can also use them
to call a function.

124
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,060
Let me show you.

125
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,190
You see here, we have a
parameter array, array of the

126
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,170
parameters.

127
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:23,140
Well, we can send in those
parameters into our

128
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,750
searchLocation function.

129
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,970
And these two lines are
basically equivalent.

130
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,950
Next up, let's talk about
objects which you're probably

131
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,190
already familiar with, the term
JavaScript objects, where

132
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,220
you have a key and
you have a value.

133
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,120
In some languages, we
call these hashes.

134
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,730
So here is an object inside
CoffeeScript, pretty basic.

135
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,610
Optionally, we can remove
the curly braces.

136
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,730
We can do without the
curly braces.

137
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:53,630
And, if we want to, we can
even get rid of a comma.

138
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:57,180
So if we write it in a spaced
out way, with two spaces in

139
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,510
this case, we can avoid
the commas.

140
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:04,040
In jQuery Air Captain's Log, we
covered how to encapsulate

141
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,880
a function inside
of an object.

142
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,510
Here's how we might do
that in CoffeeScript.

143
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,280
You'll notice here that I'm
using the @ symbol here.

144
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,040
So @name, that's going to
reference the value

145
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,040
French, in this case.

146
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,790
We can call this function by
just doing coffee.brew()

147
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:29,830
And here's the JavaScript that
it's going to generate for us.

148
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,880
Let's add one more function
to our coffee object.

149
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,240
We're going to call it pour.

150
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:39,030
It's going to have a default
parameter of one for amount.

151
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,060
And that's all there is to it.

152
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,570
Here's the JavaScript that's
going to generate for that

153
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,820
particular function.

154
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,240


155
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,890
It should be said that you need
to be careful with your

156
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,150
indenting when you're
doing CoffeeScript.

157
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,920
Obviously, indenting
matters a lot.

158
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,210
For example, if I didn't get the
indenting right with this

159
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,860
object, here's the JavaScript
that it would render out.

160
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,680


161
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,880
Let's take a look at a more
complex object, maybe an

162
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,670
object that has other objects
inside of it.

163
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,170
So here you can see I have a
bunch of different coffees

164
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,760
inside each of those coffees.

165
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,460
It has the strength of
that coffee and how

166
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,020
many I have in stock.

167
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,570
If I wanted to see how much
Italian I have in stock, I

168
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:24,120
would use this command
right here.

169
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,270
Here's the JavaScript that the
CoffeeScript is going to

170
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,520
compile into.

171
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,360


172
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,780
Now let's play with
that object.

173
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,320
What if we wanted to iterate
through that object, printing

174
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,700
out certain things?

175
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,390
Could we use a list
comprehension?

176
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,100
Well, we can, although it will
look slightly different.

177
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,450
So we're going to print out the
coffee and then the number

178
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,620
we have in stock.

179
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:50,640
We're going to iterate through
each of them, storing the key

180
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:56,170
in coffee and the rest of the
object in attributes.

181
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,400
You'll notice that of
key word there.

182
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,970
When we were doing list
comprehensions with arrays, it

183
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,580
had in instead of of.

184
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,020
When we want to iterate through
an object, we use the

185
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,310
of keyword and specify two
variables that we want to

186
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:13,440
store the key and the value in
every time it iterates through

187
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,010
things in that object.

188
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,110
Here's what this would
print out.

189
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,710
And another way we could write
this loop is by doing

190
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,960
something like this.

191
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,340


192
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,150
Now, what if we wanted to print
this out nicely, the

193
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,430
string we're creating here, but
we didn't want to include

194
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,490
any of the coffees that don't
have anything in stock?

195
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,020
What might that look like?

196
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,620
We might do something
like this, where we

197
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,260
have a to_print variable.

198
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,840
You'll notice here we're doing
when

199
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,780
attrs.in_stock > 0

200
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,740
So we're using a filter.

201
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,520
And at the very bottom, we're
joining the array together.

202
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,810
So we would get French has
20, Italian has 12.

203
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,780
If you take a look at the
JavaScript that's generated

204
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,990
from this CoffeeScript,
well, it's longer, and

205
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,340
it's not very pretty.

206
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,200
So you can start to see some
of the beautiful code that

207
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,200
CoffeeScript allows
us to write.

208
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,320
You don't have to write any
of this extra stuff to do

209
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,790
something that we can
explain using less

210
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,180
code to get more done.

211
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,430
And that's about it.

212
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,380
We've reached the end
of level four.

213
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,800
It's time to get into the
challenges, maybe do some

214
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,195
arrays, some objects, and some
list comprehensions.

215
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,960
