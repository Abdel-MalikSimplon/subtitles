1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,380

2
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,450
Congratulations, you made it
all the way to the end of A

3
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,019
Sip Of Coffee Script.

4
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:05,420
Hope you enjoyed the ride.

5
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,630
In this outro, I'm going to be
talking about other resources

6
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,480
you can use to continue
learning CoffeeScript.

7
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,290
We'll then do some credits, and
then finally, we'll just

8
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,090
thank you profusely for playing
through the course.

9
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,270
So let's get to it.

10
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,650
First of all,

11
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,560
coffeescript.org, great resource.

12
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,880
If you haven't gone through the
main CoffeeScript website

13
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,690
yet, I highly recommend
you go through it.

14
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,020
Lots of really good
information.

15
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,770
And the cool part about this is
if you scroll down, you see

16
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,049
all these different--

17
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:34,580
this Load button down here, if
you hit Load, it loads it

18
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,400
right into the Try CoffeeScript
window, so you

19
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,590
come play with it, and run it,
and experiment with modifying

20
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,960
your CoffeeScript, just
like you did in

21
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,300
the application interface.

22
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,610
Next up, Jeremy.

23
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,890
This is the guy who created
CoffeeScript.

24
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,660
He's got a GoRoku talk here
where he talks about

25
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,130
CoffeeScript for the
well-rounded Rubyist, but even

26
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:01,030
though you don't have to be a
Ruby guy to see this guy talk.

27
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,780
Pretty good talk, also, but
introductory for you at this

28
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,600
point, since you already know
some of this stuff.

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,060
Also, a little book on
CoffeeScript, another really

30
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,220
good online resource for
continuing your learning, if

31
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,410
you'd like to go and read
through more documentation.

32
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,200
Next up, also Smooth
CoffeeScript.

33
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,170
Both the previous book and
this book are free.

34
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,430
You can view it online
and go through it.

35
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,620
Next up, if you're a fan
of Ryan Bates, he did a

36
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:31,060
RailsCasts on the topic
back in May, 2011.

37
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,230
Take a look at that
if you want.

38
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:35,030
All these links, by the way,
are in the sidebar.

39
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,180
Also, if you don't mind paying
a few bucks, Geoffrey

40
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,990
Grosenbach did a CoffeeScript
PeepCode.

41
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,420
If you played through one of the
other Code School courses

42
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,610
where you got a free PeepCode,
you can use that for this if

43
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:47,800
you want to.

44
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,600
Also, the Pragmatic Programmers
put out a

45
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,160
CoffeeScript book.

46
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,390
It's a paid book, but I've heard
good things about it, so

47
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,870
I want to let you
know about it.

48
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,355
Also, my friend Mark Bates is
putting together a programming

49
00:02:00,355 --> 00:02:01,930
in CoffeeScript book.

50
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,700
It's not complete yet, but you
can view the rough cuts if you

51
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,250
go on Safari and follow
the link.

52
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,620
It might be done by the
time you're watching

53
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,610
this, so check it out.

54
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,750
Also, the CoffeeScript
Cookbook.

55
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,480
Free, online cookbook for
CoffeeScript recipes for the

56
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,380
community, by the community.

57
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,410
So this is really good
reading to sort of

58
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,340
further your knowledge.

59
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,540
So if you want to find out how
to do capitalizing words, you

60
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,100
click that, and there it goes.

61
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,430
It gives you a solution.

62
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,670
Sometimes multiple solutions.

63
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,515
Really good read to figure out
how to do complicated things

64
00:02:34,515 --> 00:02:36,480
in CoffeeScript.

65
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,880
Also, if you go to this URL on
GitHub, you'll see the most

66
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,390
popular open source projects
that are using CoffeeScript,

67
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,610
and it might be a good read.

68
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,120
It's always good to read
through code to get

69
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,970
familiar with it.

70
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,690
One of these on there, which
you might have heard of, is

71
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,770
Hubot, which is get GitHub's
Campfire bot.

72
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,610
That's all in CoffeeScript
as well.

73
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,020
OK, it's time for the credits.

74
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,490
First I've got to thank
Caike Souza, who works

75
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,820
here at Envy Labs.

76
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,630
He helped me a lot with all
the different challenges,

77
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,200
putting together all the code
for the course, and putting

78
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,350
together the course itself.

79
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:14,070
Eric Allam is one of our lead
code school developers here at

80
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:19,055
Envy Labs, and he also helped
a lot the course together.

81
00:03:19,055 --> 00:03:23,195
Tim Dikun, one of our lead
graphic designers did most of

82
00:03:23,195 --> 00:03:25,930
the graphic design that you saw
on the course, as well as

83
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,180
Drew Barontini also did
a lot of the graphic

84
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,340
design code up in CSS.

85
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,640
Everett Simpson did the jingle
that's stuck in your head.

86
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,760
CoffeeScript, yeah.

87
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,970
And Oliver Tosh is
our video guy.

88
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,610
Got to thank him for doing
all the good video.

89
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,260
And finally, everyone
else at Envy Labs.

90
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,940
While Envy Labs supports Code
School for now, it's

91
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,590
definitely not profitable yet.

92
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,090
If you dig this course
and you want to see

93
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,420
us create more content--

94
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,450
God, we spend a lot of money
on these courses--

95
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,750
if you want to see more of it,
maybe consider enrolling in

96
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,260
code school.

97
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:06,010
For just $25 a month, you can
get access to not only courses

98
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,790
as we put them out-- we try to
do about one a month-- you get

99
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,670
access to all of our Code TV
screencasts, which we put out

100
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,260
once a week, and some
other perks as well.

101
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,070
So if you're not a member yet,
consider enrolling if you want

102
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,730
to support us.

103
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,450
And I think that's about it.

104
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,470
Lastly, thank you.

105
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,660
Thank you for getting through
CoffeeScript course and

106
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,200
supporting Code School.

107
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,170
And if you want to Tweet about
it, we'd appreciate it.

108
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,380
Feel free to give us your
feedback, any feedback about

109
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,490
the course, additional courses
you want to see.

110
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,390
If you want to review the
course using that button

111
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,620
below, that would be
great as well.

112
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,770
And that's about it.

113
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,270
So, thanks for playing A Sip
Of CoffeeScript, and

114
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,520
have a great day.

115
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,640
