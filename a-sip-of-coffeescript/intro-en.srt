1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,260

2
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,730
JavaScript has been around for
a while now, and over the

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,030
years, many libraries have been
built to make it easier

4
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,770
to program and protect you from
the not so great parts of

5
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,040
JavaScript.

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,090
Allow me to illustrate.

7
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,260
See, JavaScript--

8
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,690
The Definitive Guide
has 900 pages.

9
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,310
JavaScript--

10
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,230
The Good Parts, just
176 pages.

11
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,560
Side by side, it looks something
like this, and

12
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,540
that's got to tell
you something.

13
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,040
Almost makes you wonder if
there's a book out there

14
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,060
somewhere called JavaScript--

15
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,650
The Evil Parts.

16
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,370
Well, there isn't, but this is
where CoffeeScript comes in,

17
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,280
which combines syntax from
languages like Ruby and Python

18
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,810
to create a dynamic, pleasant
language that compiles into

19
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:36,800
JavaScript.

20
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,040
So if you spend any of your
time writing JavaScript,

21
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,200
you'll probably love A
Sip Of Coffee Script.

22
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,920
In this course, we have six high
quality screen casts each

23
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,010
followed by in-browser code
challenges so you

24
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,030
can learn by doing.

25
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,810
Let's take a quick tour of
the course interface.

26
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,540
To start the course, you'll
watch through the first video.

27
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,740
You can navigate around the
video using the numbers on the

28
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,195
top, and when you're ready to
start the challenges, just hit

29
00:00:59,195 --> 00:01:01,205
the big green button
down below.

30
00:01:01,205 --> 00:01:03,550
In the challenge interface,
you'll see the number of

31
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,950
points a question is worth, the
challenge itself, and then

32
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,840
a window where you can start
typing the solution.

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,890
As you type CoffeeScript, you'll
be able to see what

34
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,710
JavaScript is generating
live on the right

35
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,170
panel for instant feedback.

36
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,770
If you get stuck at any point,
you can ask for up to three

37
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,705
hints, but of course, every time
you ask for a hint, you

38
00:01:21,705 --> 00:01:23,750
get less points for
the question.

39
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,940
Over on the right side of the
screen, you'll see your total

40
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,370
points, you'll have the ability
to jump around to

41
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:32,350
different levels or different
challenges, rewatch the video,

42
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,190
use some interface shortcuts,
and most importantly, download

43
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,375
the slides which you'll
definitely need to help solve

44
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,220
the challenges.

45
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,490
The six levels in A Sip Of
CoffeeScript start with

46
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,480
learning variables, functions,
and the command line, followed

47
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,840
by practice converting jQuery
code into CoffeeScript, We'll

48
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,410
then dive into conditionals,
operators, and comparisons for

49
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,740
level three, followed by arrays,
objects, iteration,

50
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,540
and list comprehension.

51
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,180
In level five, we'll apply these
topics to some advanced

52
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,950
jQuery, and then finally in
level six, finish up with some

53
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,650
object orientation, inheritance,
fat arrow, and

54
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,710
encapsulation.

55
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,460
Each of these levels have a
badge you'll earn as you

56
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,970
finish the level, finally
earning the course completion

57
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,800
badge, which we'll display
in your public profile.

58
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,080
You'll need to have a basic
understanding of JavaScript to

59
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,700
learn CoffeeScript, and
knowledge of some jQuery is

60
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,050
definitely recommended.

61
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,600
Fortunately, if you don't know
either of these, maybe check

62
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,350
out our jQueryAir course
over at jqueryair.com.

63
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,680
It's completely free.

64
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,030
Mmmm.

65
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,270
Got to love the taste
of CoffeeScript.

66
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,710
Definitely makes
that JavaScript

67
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,065
taste so much better.

68
00:02:33,065 --> 00:02:34,440
Want a sip?

69
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,058
