1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,120


2
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,680
So you finished the
first corpse and

3
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,140
you're hungry for more.

4
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:03,910
I don't blame you.

5
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,570
You started to pick up
momentum, and there's

6
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:06,970
something to be said for that.

7
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,840
You're probably a little more
equipped to jump into Rails

8
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,570
development, but, well, you're
not flying quite yet.

9
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,090
Don't worry.

10
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,080
You'll get there eventually, and
we're not going to leave

11
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,720
you starving for more brains,
which is why we created Rails

12
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,170
for Zombies Two, Resurrected,
where we'll teach you more

13
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,310
Rails along with some of the new
shiny bits from Rails 3.1.

14
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,100
As with our other courses, we
have five levels, which means

15
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,280
five brand new screamcasts
produced by Gregg Pollack and

16
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,380
Oliver Tosh.

17
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,870
It also means we have 52 brand
new code challenges.

18
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,390
Let's take a quick look at
the challenge system.

19
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,260
At the top here, you'll see
the number of points this

20
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,850
question is worth, current
objective, and below that, you

21
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,690
can get a hint if you
need it, although it

22
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,420
costs you a few points.

23
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,470
Some of the challenges, like
this one, are going to be in

24
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,790
the command line, so we
built a command line.

25
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,530
When you get a question correct,
your total points

26
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,300
will increase, and you'll
advance to the next challenge.

27
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,540
Down below, you can
switch between

28
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,860
challenges if you get stuck.

29
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,060
And you'll definitely want to
download the slides and our

30
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,630
cheat sheet to help you get
through all the challenges.

31
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,030
Here are the topics for each
of the levels in Rails for

32
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,040
Zombies Two.

33
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,860
Let's go through
each of these.

34
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,180
Level one will start from the
ground up, starting with the

35
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,130
basic command line tools.

36
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,755
We'll talk about the new Ruby
1.9 hash syntax, and then how

37
00:01:14,755 --> 00:01:17,630
to work with our database
using migrations.

38
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,980
In level two, we'll dive back
into our model layer,

39
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,090
exploring named scopes,
callbacks, has one, has many

40
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,400
through, and includes.

41
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,020
In level three, we'll make sure
everyone understands rest

42
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,940
before building some forms and
talking about nested resources

43
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,120
and view helpers.

44
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,415
In level four, we'll talk about
how to send emails in

45
00:01:34,415 --> 00:01:37,140
our Rails app with Action
Mailer, followed by a dive

46
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,640
into the new Rails 3.1 asset
pipeline, and how to use Sassy

47
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,726
CSS, CoffeeScript, and Sprockets
with Rails right out

48
00:01:43,726 --> 00:01:45,010
of the box.

49
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,500
In level five, we'll look at
rendering options, stuff you

50
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,910
need to know if you ever want
to build an API from Rails.

51
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,920
And lastly, we'll tie everything
together to do some

52
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,650
killer AJAX.

53
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,930
Every time you finish a level
in Rails for Zombies Two,

54
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,410
you'll get a new badge, finally
earning a course

55
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,770
completion badge.

56
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,170
But besides a badge, when you
finish the course, you'll get

57
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,090
access to the final course
video, a blooper reel about

58
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,009
takes from the videos, $5 in
Code School cash to apply

59
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:09,910
toward your next course or
towards your monthly

60
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,950
subscription, and a few prizes,
including a free month

61
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,810
of RailsCasts Pro from Ryan
Bates and $10 off Michael

62
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,290
Hartl's Rails Tutorial PDF
and screencast bundle.

63
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,640
If you haven't heard yet about
Code School's enrollment, for

64
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,340
a low monthly fee, you get
unlimited access to all paid

65
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,380
courses, priority access to
new courses as we develop

66
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,250
them, access to Code TV
screencasts with additional

67
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,790
content between course releases,
and a few other

68
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,900
privileges.

69
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,760
Whether you buy it outright or
get a subscription, we hope

70
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,260
you're ready for Rails
for Zombies Two.

71
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,840
So cleanse your palate because
here comes the second corpse.

72
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,090
Bon appetit.

73
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,213
