1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,260

2
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,070
Congratulations.

3
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,830
You've made it to the end
of Rails For Zombies 2.

4
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,770
You deserve a lollipop with
a first prize on it.

5
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:07,710
Or, or wait.

6
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,780
How about a heart on a stick?

7
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,980
Yeah, that's more zombie like.

8
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,430
Oh, wait.

9
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,250
Oh, wait, better yet, how
about a brain pop?

10
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,110
Here's what's crazy.

11
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,250
There's really such a thing
as a brain pop.

12
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,640
Everything I'm about to talk
about, including the brain

13
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,400
pops, can be found on the
links in the sidebar,

14
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,040
including a Rails For Zombies
2 t-shirt which looks like

15
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,100
this on the front and
this on the back.

16
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,619
We also still have Rails For
Zombies one t-shirts available

17
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:34,606
if you want to go retro.

18
00:00:34,606 --> 00:00:36,470
You've come pretty far learning
Rails, but you're

19
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,210
probably wondering
where to go next.

20
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,220
Well, it's a good question.

21
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,760
I'm going to give you
lots of options.

22
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,570
First up, you may want to
download the source for the

23
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,320
completed course Rails app.

24
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,650
This is a functioning Rails app
that contains all the code

25
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,370
samples you saw in the slides,
and everything you completed

26
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,650
in the challenges.

27
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,220
If you've already created a
Rails app or two on your own,

28
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,400
or, you know, you go and do
that, you might want to come

29
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,030
back and check out our Rails
best practices course.

30
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,850
We go over ways to keep your
application organized and more

31
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:01,950
maintainable.

32
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,099
When it's time to create email
subscriptions on your Rails

33
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,510
app and do mass mailing, don't
forget to check out

34
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,960
madmimi.com and use the
Mad Mimi Ruby Gen.

35
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,140
You might notice below you have
some prizes, including a

36
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,700
link that will get
you one month of

37
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,910
RailsCasts Pro for free.

38
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,050
In case you're not familiar,
Ryan Bates releases one free

39
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,000
Rails screencast over on
rails.com per week.

40
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,410
And recently he decided to
introduce a pro subscription

41
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,130
where he's putting out more
advanced screencasts.

42
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,890
$10.00 off the
railstutorial.org's PDF

43
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,005
screencast bundle.

44
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:32,610
You see, Michael Hartl created
this great Ruby on Rails

45
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,270
tutorial, which if you click
this book button right here,

46
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,480
you can read for free.

47
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,410
The whole thing online.

48
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,350
If you want to support him,
though, if you go back to the

49
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,140
front page and scroll down,
you'll see that the PDF is

50
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,360
available for $26.00 the
screencast $85.00, and both

51
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,510
the screencast and the
PDF for $95.00.

52
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,510
And here's the cool thing.

53
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,780
If you use the discount code
codeschool, you can get $10.00

54
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,080
off the bundle, which means it's
the same price as getting

55
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,360
just the screencast, so you
might as well get that.

56
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,110
Also, a great resource
for learning Rails

57
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,640
are the Rails guides.

58
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,070
Really.

59
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,630
Take the time, read through
these, they are full of great

60
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,240
information.

61
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,050
Also, Ryan Bates' railscast.com
is a great

62
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,600
resource for learning all sorts
of things about Rails

63
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,150
and Rails libraries.

64
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,280
I'm also a really big fan of the
Agile Web Development with

65
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:17,910
Rails book.

66
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,260
That's how I learned Rails
with the first edition.

67
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,800
Now it's in its fourth
edition, and it even

68
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,300
covers Rails 3.1.

69
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,535
Also got to make sure you know
about Ruby 5, that's Envy

70
00:02:27,535 --> 00:02:29,880
Labs' twice weekly news podcast
where we cover the

71
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,905
latest news in the
Ruby community.

72
00:02:31,905 --> 00:02:34,650
You can find it on iTunes, and
it's a really good thing to

73
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,100
listen to you, like, say, when
you're mowing the lawn,

74
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,800
driving your hot dog,
or washing your cat.

75
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,695
And if you're not an audio
person, that's OK.

76
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:43,990
You can subscribe
to the RSS feed.

77
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,942
It's full of a lot of
information you should know as

78
00:02:45,942 --> 00:02:47,120
a Ruby developer.

79
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,900
Lastly, got to let you know
about Top Ruby Jobs.

80
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,150
If you're looking for a Ruby job
now, or you're trying to

81
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,980
recruit a Ruby developer,
check out Top Ruby Jobs.

82
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,860
And now we've reached
the credits.

83
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,490
First we need to thank everybody
at Envy Labs.

84
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,030
There's now, at this point when
I'm making this video,

85
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,740
there's 20 people here, and each
of them contributed in

86
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,630
some way to this video,
most definitely.

87
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,700
Got to thank Oliver Tosh,
who did all the film.

88
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,450
Production Tyler Koeller, who
did the intro video, and

89
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,952
Everett Simpson, who did
the jingle that's

90
00:03:11,952 --> 00:03:12,950
stuck in your head.

91
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,390
And of course, I need
to thank you.

92
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,130
Thank you for sporting Code
School, getting all the way

93
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,430
through the course, learning
some Rails.

94
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,880
If you want to show
your appreciation,

95
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,500
please give us a review.

96
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,840

what you think.

98
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,880
This also might be a good
opportunity to tell all your

99
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,200
Twitter friends about your
awesome accomplishment.

100
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,890
See that Twitter link
over there?

101
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:38,540
If you have any feedback, feel
free to tweet @codeschool, and

102
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,600
definitely follow Code School
if you want to be aware of

103
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,350
additional courses that
we're going to create.

104
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,160
There are definitely more Rails
ones in the pipeline.

105
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,170
So, I hope you have a great
week, and thanks for playing.

106
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,613
