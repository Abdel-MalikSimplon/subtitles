1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,420
(SINGING) Put down your brains
and your entrails.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,340
It's time to stop and learn
some Rails, 'cause we got

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:12,175
something new to grab-- "Rails
for Zombies" by Envy Labs.

4
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,380
Congratulations, you made
it to Level 3--

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,900
REST in Pieces.

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,220
In this level, we're going to
be looking through REST.

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,330
You get a brief introduction
to REST, revisit some URL

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,450
helpers, take a closer
look at forms.

9
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,830
We haven't really done forms
yet, so I'm going to get you

10
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,610
familiar with the
form helpers.

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,050
We'll then jump into nested
resources, look at some

12
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,650
partials, and some additional
view helpers, which you may

13
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,460
need to use in your
rails views.

14
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,700
So let's jump into it.

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,650
So REST stands for

16
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,010
Representational State Transfer.

17
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,230
And it was coined by this guy,
Roy Fielding, in his

18
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,240
dissertation.

19
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,840
I highly recommend that you
skip his dissertation.

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,170
It's a lot of technical
reading.

21
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,900
It'll put to sleep.

22
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,580
But a good example of REST--
it has a lot of REST

23
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,280
principles--

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,630
is simply the HTTP protocol.

25
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,330
The protocol contains resources
addressable through

26
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,270
URIs, or Uniform Resource
Identifiers.

27
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,900
The HTTP protocol also
has standard methods.

28
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,490
A bunch of them-- four of them
that we care about in this

29
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,715
case-- are GET, POST,
PUT, and DELETE.

30
00:01:20,715 --> 00:01:22,620
If you want to learn more
about REST and building

31
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,500
RESTful web services, check out
the book by the same name

32
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,410
by Leonard Richardson
and Sam Ruby.

33
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,700
In the early days
of Rails, things

34
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,660
weren't always so RESTful.

35
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,070
Let me show you an example.

36
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,530
Here's a controller--

37
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,760
a UserController--

38
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,440
and here are some actions
in there.

39
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,180
You see the actions are
all over the place.

40
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,600
This is bad because, well,
it lends itself to huge

41
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,100
controllers with lots
of methods and

42
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,820
lots of codes in it--

43
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,690
not so good--

44
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,870
also bad because there's going
to be multiple models per

45
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,780
controller, which is
also not good.

46
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,890
It's sort of become a best
practice to only have one

47
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,802
concern per controller, one
resource per controller.

48
00:02:01,802 --> 00:02:04,800
With Rails 1, things started
getting more RESTful.

49
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,990
You can see here we have our
standard show, create, update,

50
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,630
and destroy actions, and in
comments next to them, you can

51
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,710
see how we call them, using
GET, POST, POST, and POST.

52
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,260
Not so good yet, because we're
repeating the verb.

53
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,660
If you look at the verb here,
which is GET and POST, and the

54
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,830
actual URIs, we're repeating
the verb.

55
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,510
If that doesn't make
sense, we'll come

56
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,610
back to it in a second.

57
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,970
As you saw a minute ago with
Rails 1, we have our standard

58
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,960
actions of show, create,
update, and destroy.

59
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,810
These actions map pretty well
to SQL statements, namely

60
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,220
select, create, update,
and delete.

61
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,980
Then how we're doing them in
REST with the controller,

62
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:50,760
we're using GET, POST,
POST, and POST--

63
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,930
something kind of fishy here.

64
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,240
With Rails 2 and above, though,
we have the same

65
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:02,280
actions, same SQL, except we're
using get, post, put,

66
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,140
and delete.

67
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,150
So that should feel a little bit
better because we're using

68
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,430
the proper verb.

69
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:15,650
So update is to put, and
destroy is to delete.

70
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,070
Let's take a look at the verbs
and the URI side by side.

71
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,730
So the verb we're using--

72
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,330
GET, POST, POST, and POST.

73
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,500
And then in Rails 1, we were
using /users/show/3,

74
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,640
/users/create, /users/update/3,
and

75
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,310
/users/destroy/3.

76
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,130
Can you see this?

77
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,520
We're repeating the verb.

78
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,210
We're repeating update
and destroy twice.

79
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,370
In Rails 2 and above, we're
using GET, POST, PUT, and

80
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,130
DELETE, which means we can
simplify this, get rid of

81
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,230
those verbs inside of our URIs
and simply have /users/3,

82
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,880
/users, /users/3,
and /users/3--

83
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,960
much cleaner.

84
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,420
Now, we're going to go through
some REST flash cards to get

85
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,460
things solidified
in your brain.

86
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,350
So I'm going to give you an
action, could be a method

87
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,680
name, and then, together, we're
going to figure out the

88
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,610
proper verb and the noun,
starting with Show user.

89
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,690
So when I say Show user,
what is that?

90
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:13,390
Well, that means GET User.

91
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,280
And this little URL down there,
that's giving you sort

92
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,399
of an example of a URL
you might use to

93
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,570
identify this user.

94
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,520
Create user-- what's
that going to be?

95
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:28,000
Well, that's going to be POST
User-- create is to post.

96
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,280
What about Update user?

97
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,070
Well, as we learned a minute
ago, update is PUT,

98
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,010
so we do PUT User.

99
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,480
What about Destroy?

100
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,030
Well, Destroy is DELETE User.

101
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,680
Now, we're going to make it a
little bit more complicated.

102
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,250
What about Play Global
Thermonuclear War?

103
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,490
How might we represent that
as a REST verb and noun?

104
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,660
Well, what are we doing when
we're playing a game?

105
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,510
We are creating a game, so
we might make this POST

106
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,550
GlobalThermonuclearWar--

107
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,490
makes sense.

108
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,695
What about Process credit
card transaction?

109
00:05:02,695 --> 00:05:03,010
Hm.

110
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,460
Well, let's think about what
are we doing in that credit

111
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,330
card transaction.

112
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:11,320
We're creating a credit card
transaction, so we're doing

113
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,280
POST Transaction.

114
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,560
Take a look at that
URL down there.

115
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,690
I'm actually using a
nested URL here.

116
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,750
I'm signifying that it's for
order number 5, and that

117
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,920
credit card transaction
with order number 5.

118
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,685
What about Subscribe
to mailing list?

119
00:05:26,685 --> 00:05:29,050
Well, what are we doing?

120
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:37,050
We're creating a subscription,
so POST Subscription--

121
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:37,990
makes sense.

122
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,060
What about Logout?

123
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,240
OK, this one's tricky.

124
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,750
What are we creating or
destroying in this case, when

125
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,370
we log out?

126
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,450
Well, really what we're
talking about

127
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,650
is a session, right?

128
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,560
When we log in, we're creating a
session, so when we log out,

129
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,930
we are deleting a Session.

130
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,490
Hopefully, with these examples,
REST is starting to

131
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,940
make a little more
sense to you.

132
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,790
Let's jump back into how
Rails is doing it.

133
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:10,200
So in Rails 1, here's our
actions and our URLs.

134
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,450
And in Rails 2, here's the same
actions, and here are the

135
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,205
proper URLs, or nouns.

136
00:06:17,205 --> 00:06:20,630
It should feel a little
bit cleaner.

137
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,190
One thing you might be wondering
if you're taking a

138
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,530
close look at these URLs is
how do we link to them,

139
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,790
because some of these URLs,
the nouns are the same--

140
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,295
/users/3.

141
00:06:30,295 --> 00:06:32,910
Well, let's take a look at how
we might do that in Rails.

142
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,480
For our show or our GET request,
we simply do link_to

143
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,510
'show' and then specify
the zombie.

144
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,990
For the create request,
we do 'create',

145
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,840
zombie, method: :post.

146
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,730
For calling the update,
we could call

147
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,080
zombie, method: :put.

148
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,950
And for destroy, we could do
zombie, method: :delete.

149
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,920
Now, on post input,
we typically

150
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,660
wouldn't have a link.

151
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,640
They'd typically be
a form, but this

152
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,970
is still valid syntax.

153
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,690
Right now, some of
you are thinking

154
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:57,730
wait a minute here,

155
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,360
wait a minute here.

156
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,190
Browsers don't support
PUT and DELETE.

157
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,470
Yeah, they don't.

158
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,220
That's actually a pretty
good point.

159
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,550
So how is it that our Rails
application understands both

160
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,695
PUT and DELETE?

161
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,500
Well, let's take a look at
what these links are

162
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,250
generating under the covers.

163
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,270
What they're generating is
something that looks like this

164
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,850
on our page.

165
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:21,880
Here you might notice two
HTML5 data attributes.

166
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,040
Hm.

167
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,710
That's interesting.

168
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,850
What are those doing there?

169
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,370
Well, it turns out that Rails
by default has some

170
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,690
unobtrusive JavaScript that
looks for these attributes and

171
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:33,310
it finds these attributes, it
grabs them, and changes the

172
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,090
code to create forms.

173
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,460
So in this case, it's going to
create a post form, and it's

174
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,590
going to hide that method inside
this hidden input field

175
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,940
called method, and it's
going to specify

176
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,220
the method in there.

177
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,040
Then when our Rails app sees
that method parameter, it's

178
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,630
going to grab it and set
that as our method.

179
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,220
It does this all
under the hood.

180
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,010
You never have to worry about
doing it yourself manually or

181
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,890
even worrying about that
browsers don't

182
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,210
support PUT or DELETE.

183
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,320
It's all invisible to you.

184
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,920
Remember, back in Zombies 1, we
talked a little bit about

185
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,310
routes and this line,
resources :zombies.

186
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,090
That's the line that
creates all of our

187
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,960
RESTful Rails routes.

188
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,460
Well, to list out all the
routes that it creates,

189
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,690
there's a rake task for that
called rake routes.

190
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:24,720
You can see here it prints out
our path names, our verbs, our

191
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,940
URLs, followed by
the action and

192
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,920
controller that gets called.

193
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,390
These paths on the left side, we
can use as a key to figure

194
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:34,390
out what to put in our
link_to calls.

195
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,309
So, here, we have link_to
zombies_path, link_to

196
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:41,020
new_zombie_path, link_to
edit_zombie_path.

197
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,340
Here we have zombie_path.

198
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,950
And to do that last one, Show
Zombie, we can also write that

199
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,060
by sending in the
actual zombie.

200
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,220
These zombie helpers, like
zombies_path and

201
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:55,720
new_zombie_path, generate the
relative path to the resource.

202
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,430
But what if we want
the full URL?

203
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,800
Let's say we want to provide
that URL so people can copy

204
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,640
and paste it, let's say, into
their blog, or social media,

205
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,820
or you're creating a tweet, or
you're liking it on Facebook,

206
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,380
or even in your email.

207
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,590
You're sending out an email,
and you need to provide the

208
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,770
full path-- the whole URL?

209
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:19,440
Well, in that case, we can use
these same paths, but we just

210
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,110
do zombies_url instead
of _path.

211
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,850
That's going to print out the
absolute path with the URL.

212
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,910
We're about halfway done.

213
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:34,540
Now, we're going to jump back
into Forms and Input Helpers.

214
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,310
So if you took a look in the
scaffold that we generated, it

215
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,410
has a form_for line that looks
something like this--

216
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,430
form_for zombie.

217
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,700
If zombie isn't saved to the
database yet, it's going to

218
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,310
generate a form which looks
like this-- doing a post.

219
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,550
And if our zombie's already
saved to the database, it's

220
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,550
going to create this HTML.

221
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,130
You can see here it's specifying
that the method on

222
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,590
this form is 'put'.

223
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,150
At the bottom of our
form, you'll see it

224
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,050
has a submit helper.

225
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,340
It calls f.submit.

226
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,260
If the zombie isn't saved to
the database, it's going to

227
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,110
create a commit button with the
value of Create Zombie.

228
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,480
And if zombie's already saved to
the database, it's going to

229
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,150
create a button with the
value Update Zombie.

230
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:22,400
Now, let's jump into some input
fields, starting with

231
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,390
text field.

232
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,780
When we submit this form, it's
going to send these request

233
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,590
parameters.

234
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,010
We could see these if we
looked in our log.

235
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,210
If zombie isn't saved to the
database yet, it's going to

236
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,820
print out something that
looks like this.

237
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,790
If zombie's already saved to the
database, it's going to

238
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,250
print out the same thing, except
it's going to put the

239
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,480
zombie name, which in
this case is Eric.

240
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,200
And if a zombie name has a
validation error-- if it

241
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,720
doesn't get saved properly--

242
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,970
it's going to wrap that
and in a div called

243
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,320
"field_with_errors", which will
allow us to put a big red

244
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,800
box around that field to
signify that it has a

245
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,120
validation error.

246
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,010
The other helper you're going
to see in your scaffold that

247
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,790
was created for you by default
are these labels.

248
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,190
So here we have f.label :name.

249
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,010
This is going to render
out label for-

250
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,800
"zombie_name">Name--

251
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,100
just a label for you to
use with your CSS.

252
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,490
And if the zombie has a
validation error, it's going

253
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,880
to wrap that, again, in a div
called "field_with_errors".

254
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,080
So if we have a validation on
our zombie name, which I think

255
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,090
we do, to make sure that it
has a name, it's going to

256
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,880
print out something that
looks like this in

257
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,420
our scaffold by default.

258
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,820
Here are a couple common input
helpers that you might use in

259
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,660
your Rails app.

260
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,790
We have text_area,
which in this case,

261
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,820
we're using for bio.

262
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,510
It's going to print out
a big text area box.

263
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,360
We have check_box, which is
really useful for booleans--

264
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,800
true or false.

265
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,340
For radio buttons, we can list
out a bunch of them here,

266
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,510
where we're selecting
the decomposition

267
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,820
status of the zombie.

268
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,680
For a select box, we use a
syntax that looks like this,

269
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,850
so we can select the
decomposition status--

270
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,770
"fresh", "rotting",
or "stale".

271
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,810
Sometimes we have select boxes
where an attribute is

272
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,770
associated with a number.

273
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,930
So, in this case, if "fresh"
was 1, and "rotting" was 2,

274
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:08,620
and "stale" was 3, we would
write this out.

275
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,860
Next, I'm going to tell you
about a couple additional text

276
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,110
input helpers which have
different types.

277
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,770
So each of these has input,
but then they have type.

278
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,020
For example, the first
one has password.

279
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,040
The browser is going to see that
typed password, and it's

280
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,960
going to know that it should
have dots instead of the

281
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,660
actual password, so people
can't read your screen.

282
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,010
Next up is the number_field
helper, which in some

283
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,302
browsers, it's going to give
you a number field on the

284
00:12:32,302 --> 00:12:34,530
side, and some, it even
gives you commas

285
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,160
in your number fields.

286
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,870
Then you have a range_field.

287
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:42,030
Again, some browsers choose to
implement this as a slider.

288
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,570
Most browsers aren't going to
do anything special with the

289
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,270
email_field.

290
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,720
Maybe, eventually, they'll
do some client side

291
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,120
validation on email.

292
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,610
But where this is, I think, most
useful, is when you have

293
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,810
mobile browsers, because mobile
browsers will give a

294
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:55,560
different keyboard.

295
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,160
You tell someone to type in an
email address on your iPhone,

296
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,600
it's going to look like this.

297
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,440
Same deal with url_field.

298
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,690
On most desktop browsers, it's
not going to do anything

299
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:07,820
special, but on your iPhone,
it's going to look like this.

300
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,590
And then, finally,
telephone_field.

301
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:14,060
Again, it looks like this
on your iPhone.

302
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,360
Next up, I want to introduce
you guys to nested routes.

303
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,920
Let's jump back into
our routes.rb.

304
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,030
Here you can see we have
resources :zombies and

305
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,200
resources :tweets.

306
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,370
Some of the URLs that we might
get based on these routes--

307
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:32,030
well, to find a tweet, we would
have /tweets/2, and to

308
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:35,000
find all zombies tweets, we
might use /tweets?zombie_id=4.

309
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,610
This should feel a little
fishy to you.

310
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,800
It's not so good.

311
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,480
It's not very RESTful.

312
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,920
Tweets shouldn't really exist
without a zombie, so we can be

313
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,550
doing better RESTfully here.

314
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,350
So how do we do that?

315
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,840
How do we maybe use the
nested resource?

316
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,260
What we're going to do here is
we're going to switch it

317
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,270
around, so we're going to have
resources :zombies do

318
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,450
resources :tweets.

319
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:03,330
OK, so we sort of nested
tweets inside zombies.

320
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:06,120
This gives us access
to different URLs.

321
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,780
So here we can say,
/zombies/4/tweets/2, and then

322
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,470
to find all zombies' tweets, we
can do /zombies/4/tweets.

323
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,260
A couple things we need to do
to make this work throughout

324
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,680
our Rails application, we're
going to need to update our

325
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,780
controller and update all
the links and form_for.

326
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,150
So let's go ahead
and do that--

327
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,220
see what it looks like.

328
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,140
So here's our two actions, and
here are the parameters that

329
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,150
it's sending in.

330
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:33,230
So you can see, based on these
parameters, how it's sending

331
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:36,160
in the zombie_id versus
the tweet id.

332
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,170
The tweet ID is just
ID, whereas the

333
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,690
zombie ID is just zombie_id.

334
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,250
So here's our TweetsController.

335
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,180
Inside of our TweetsController,
we're going

336
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,470
to have our show action
to show a tweet.

337
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,620
And before we get into
our show action, we

338
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,260
can find the zombie.

339
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,400
Every action in this controller
is going to be

340
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,210
associated with a zombie, so
let's find the zombie.

341
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,940
Let's wrap that in a method
called get_zombie, then we can

342
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,630
call that using a before_filter
at the top of

343
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,800
our controller.

344
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,440
So we're going to fetch
the zombie before we

345
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,190
get into the action.

346
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,890
Then once we get into
the action, show.

347
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:14,440
We can call tweet =
zombie.tweets.find to find the

348
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,860
tweet for that zombie.

349
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,060
Wrapping it like this calling
zombie tweets is basically

350
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:24,270
using the scope of that zombie
to make sure that the tweets

351
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,370
we have access to under that
zombie are just the tweets for

352
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,470
that zombie.

353
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,750
Now, let's try to find all
the tweets for Zombie 4.

354
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,110
This is going to call the
index action in our

355
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:36,930
controller.

356
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:42,190
And inside there, all we do is
@tweets = @zombie.tweets because

357
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:46,360
we're finding all the tweets
for that zombie.

358
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,090
So that resources line is
nested, which is going to

359
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,840
create some different looking
routes for us.

360
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,100
How do we figure out
what they are?

361
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,120
Well, we run rake routes.

362
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,420
So here's what the rake routes
file looks like.

363
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,970
We have zombie tweets in
many different places.

364
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:03,330
We can use this print-out to
figure out how to link to

365
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,890
zombie tweets, so here's how
we get to zombie tweets.

366
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:10,510
We can get a new tweet using
new_zombie_tweet_path.

367
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,040
Here's how we do an edit.

368
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,330
Notice here we need to send in
both the zombie and the tweet.

369
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,905
Here's how we show a specific
tweet for a zombie.

370
00:16:18,905 --> 00:16:22,060
And here's the short version
of doing that--

371
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,860
basically wrapping both
variables in an array.

372
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,200
We can also use that array
when we go to write the

373
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,930
destroy link.

374
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,630
Where might we see these
links in action?

375
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,785
Well, let's jump into
our index view.

376
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,600
Here you can see we're iterating
through all of the

377
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,900
different tweets, and we can
"Show", "Edit", "Destroy", and

378
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,880
"New", all using these new
routes that were created from

379
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,165
our nested route.

380
00:16:44,165 --> 00:16:45,580
Another view we're going
to have to change

381
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,440
slightly is our form.

382
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,440
So we look inside of our form
here, and we need to include

383
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,720
not only the tweet, but also
the zombie in an array.

384
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:59,000
Let's jump back into the
TweetsController.

385
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,090
So here you can see our standard
create method that

386
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,940
our scaffold created for us.

387
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,619
We need to modify this to
reflect our new routes.

388
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:11,750
First, at the top, we can change
this so that it has

389
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,190
@zombie.tweets.

390
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:16,760
Then we can say redirect_to
@zombie, @tweet--

391
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,280
render json, @zombie, @tweet--
location, @zombie, @tweet.

392
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,530
And that's all we have to do.

393
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,720
We're almost done
with this level.

394
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,640
All that's left is talking about
partials and a couple

395
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,410
view helpers.

396
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,220
You may already be familiar
with partials.

397
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,090
And the most common partial
out there is this form

398
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:38,090
partial, which was created by
our scaffold for what we need

399
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,510
to create and update--

400
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,810
the tweet.

401
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,390
We can tell it's a partial
because it has that underscore

402
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,320
method there.

403
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,270
And if we look inside of our new
view, we can see where it

404
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,070
gets inserted.

405
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,580
And here is the edit view, and
we can see where it renders

406
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,950
the form into our edit view.

407
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,950
Next up, we're going to talk a
little bit about security.

408
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,980
You don't want people
to be able to do

409
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,680
this in your website--

410
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,520
put in malicious JavaScript and
then get it to execute on

411
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,860
other people's browsers when
they view the page, right?

412
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,410
Your user input need
to be escaped.

413
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:16,220
Hopefully, it does something
like this, where it escapes

414
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,470
that script to use the proper
escaping there.

415
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:25,440
Well, back in Rails 2, when it
came to user input, by default

416
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,970
when we printed something to
the screen, it would be

417
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,020
unsafe, like this.

418
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:33,800
We always had to remember to use
that h command to properly

419
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,730
get things to escape.

420
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,790
But in Rails 3, all variables
that we print out to our views

421
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,760
are going to be escaped
by default.

422
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,380
This is great.

423
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,710
You're less likely to shoot
yourself in the foot.

424
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,560
However, there are some cases
where you do want to print out

425
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,300
user-generated HTML and
JavaScript to the screen, in

426
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,450
which case, you just need
to use the raw command.

427
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,240
So raw's not going to
escape anything.

428
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,930
It's going to print it out.

429
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,150
So here we have some view code
where we're printing out all

430
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,750
of the tweets--

431
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,940
putting them each in a div.

432
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,760
Each div has a unique
ID because maybe

433
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,820
we're doing some AJAX.

434
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:13,290
Well, you should be familiar
with the div_for helper.

435
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:13,880
So check it out.

436
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,690
We can write this using the
div_for helper like so, and

437
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:20,050
it's going to do the
same exact thing.

438
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:23,120
What it's doing under the
covers, as well, is it's

439
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,280
calling the dom_id on our active
record object, and

440
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,460
that's how it's getting
the ID, which it's

441
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,405
using in the div.

442
00:19:31,405 --> 00:19:31,790
Hm.

443
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,920
This will come in useful later
when we're writing some AJAX,

444
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,810
and we're writing some
JavaScript, and we need to

445
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,540
maybe do something to that
specific div, we're going to

446
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:43,190
call dom_id for that specific
object, get back the dom_id

447
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:48,340
that we want to make
disappear or reappear.

448
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,880
Next, we're going to take a
look at a couple string

449
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,330
helpers, starting
with truncate.

450
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,310
So, in this case, we're taking
"I need brains!" and

451
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,980
truncating it to 10
characters, which,

452
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,490
unfortunately, is going to
print out "I need bra".

453
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,070
Zombies don't need bras, so
what we're going to do

454
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,430
instead, we're going to have one
more parameter, so it's no

455
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,260
longer any bra.

456
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,410
We're going to add
a separator.

457
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,980
So this is saying, basically,
make sure the last character

458
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,590
is a space.

459
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,200
So, in this case, it's just
going to print out "I need",

460
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,362
which is better.

461
00:20:19,362 --> 00:20:22,370
Next up is the pluralize helper,
where we can send in a

462
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:26,380
number of things and then a
word, and if it's one item,

463
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,870
it's going to say,
"I see 1 zombie.

464
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:31,010
If it's two, it's going to
say, "I see 2 zombies".

465
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:34,190
ActiveSupport adds a bunch of
string helpers, one of which

466
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,320
is titleize.

467
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,980
So if we want to make sure all
of our names on our websites

468
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,080
are titleized, we can call
titleize and it'll print out

469
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,554
"His name was Ash William".

470
00:20:44,554 --> 00:20:47,550
The next helper we're going
to look at is to_sentence.

471
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:50,530
So this takes an array, and
it's simply going to put

472
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,000
commas and an and.

473
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,730
So, in this case,
we have Captain,

474
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,900
Soldier, and Brain Taster.

475
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,010
There's also time_ago_in_words,
which is really useful

476
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,100
for date/time fields.

477
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,490
So we can say, "He was buried
alive 2 days ago".

478
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,980
If you're dealing with money,

479
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,960
number_to_currency is pretty helpful.

480
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,870
It'll format things properly.

481
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,310
And lastly, number_to_human
is really nice when you're

482
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,650
dealing with large numbers.

483
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,840
So we can just put in a bunch of
numbers and it'll translate

484
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,950
that to, "Ash is 13.2
billion years old".

485
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,480
The best way to learn about more
view helpers is to simply

486
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,100
take a read through the Active
Support Core Extensions guide.

487
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,600
There's a ton of great material
in there.

488
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:34,420
So you've reached the
end of Level 3.

489
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,590
You've done a great
job so far.

490
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,420
You definitely deserve
some brains.

491
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,355
But, first, in code challenges,
you'll apply what

492
00:21:40,355 --> 00:21:41,605
you've learned.
