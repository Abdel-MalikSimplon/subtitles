00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,690
You're watching
Discover Drive where

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:06,470
we're going to be talking about
downloading and sharing files.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,210
So our application
might have just

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:12,690
fetched a bunch of metadata,
saw a bunch of file IDs,

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,360
and now we want to
download a specific file.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,130
How do we do that?

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,970
Well, if we don't have the
metadata yet for this file,

8
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,770
we're going to want to fetch it
by doing a files.get request.

9
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,090
In the metadata, we're going
to find a download URL.

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,090
Next, we're going to make a
new API call, this time passing

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,580
in just the download_URL
as a URI option.

12
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,330
What this is going
to do is return

13
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,680
the binary data for this file.

14
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,110
In this case, pug.jpg.

15
00:00:50,355 --> 00:00:53,470
But having the binary data
doesn't do us any good.

16
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:57,130
We need to store this in
a file in our file system.

17
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,900
So since this is
Ruby, we're going

18
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,995
to call file.open and just
write it out to the file system.

19
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,980
Why don't you give this
a try in the challenges.
