1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,110
I'm Gregg Pollack, and
you're watching Google Drive.

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,780
Before we get into
it, we need to make

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,150
sure everybody understands
what Google Drive is.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,130
It's a storage
service that allows

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,680
us to organize, back
up, share photos, videos,

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,740
or any other file
in Google's cloud.

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,096
If you have a Google account
and you go to drive.google.com,

8
00:00:22,096 --> 00:00:24,040
you'll see all the
files that you currently

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,220
have stored in Drive.

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,050
What's great about
this is you can access

11
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,640
these files from your home,
work, or mobile-- any place

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,860
that you have a web browser.

13
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,660
Recently, Google created
some native applications.

14
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,540
So you can install Google
Drive on any of your devices,

15
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,620
and they'll automatically
sync and be up to date,

16
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,880
no matter where you are.

17
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,030
What makes Google Drive
even more powerful

18
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,480
is that they've created a
series of Developer Tools that

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,540
allows you to integrate Google
Drive into your application.

20
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,180
The first two Developer Tools
we're going to be looking at

21
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,350
are JavaScript tools.

22
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,870
The first is the
Save to Drive button.

23
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,950
This you would put in
your web application

24
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,200
if you have a file you
want to allow users

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,680
to download into
their Google Drive.

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,980
In the second level, we'll be
looking at the Google Picker.

27
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,740
This replaces your
traditional Upload File form

28
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,690
with something a
little easier to use.

29
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,480
You're probably already familiar
with some applications that

30
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,150
use the Drive API to
store their files.

31
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,480
Applications like Google
Docs, Sheets, and Slides

32
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,590
all use Google Drive as
their primary storage.

33
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,720
When you create new files
using these applications,

34
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,440
you will see them inside
your Google Drive, which

35
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,450
makes it really easy
to click on them

36
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,860
and open them back up in
the appropriate application.

37
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,320
In the same way,
the Google Drive API

38
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,400
allows you to create
applications and use

39
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,055
Google Drive as the
primary user storage.

40
00:01:58,055 --> 00:02:00,180
The application we're going
to be building together

41
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,595
in this course is
Pictures of Pugs,

42
00:02:02,595 --> 00:02:05,770
you know, to store all
of our pictures of pugs.

43
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:09,750
And the storage here is going to
be using the Google Drive API.

44
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,140
Once our users interact
with our application,

45
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,240
if later they go to
drive.google.com,

46
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,730
they might see a couple
of the pictures that

47
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,785
were saved from our application.

48
00:02:19,785 --> 00:02:21,160
Levels three
through 11, we'll be

49
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,160
going through lots of
different actions you

50
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,540
can do with the Google Drive
API, from uploading files,

51
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,170
to downloading files,
to updating files,

52
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,110
to getting push
notifications, and even

53
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:36,270
installing and showcasing
your application.

54
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,209
Let me show you what that means.

55
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:40,750
When we're inside
Google Drive and we

56
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,000
want to create a new file, we
might hit the Create button.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,170
This asks us what kind of
file we want to create,

58
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,520
whether it's a document,
presentation, spreadsheet,

59
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,010
or something else.

60
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,930
Well, Google Drive API allows
you to install your application

61
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,430
inside someone's drive.

62
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,080
So as you can see here,
I can create a new file

63
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,060
with Pictures of
Pugs, our application.

64
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,790
We can also open existing
files inside Pictures of Pugs

65
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,810
by right-clicking on
it inside Google Drive

66
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,095
and selecting Open
with Pictures of Pugs.

67
00:03:17,004 --> 00:03:19,420
In this first level, we're
going to be looking at the Save

68
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,340
to Drive button.

69
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,710
The Save to Drive button
allows your website visitors

70
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,100
to save files into
their Google Drive.

71
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,410
Whether they need to save an
image, a document, a song,

72
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,630
or something else,
there's simply

73
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,739
going to be a link
on your website

74
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,280
that they're going
to click on, and it

75
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,440
will allow them to
save it to Drive.

76
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,520
Here's a picture of
a pug on our website

77
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,040
that we want to allow
a user to save to Drive.

78
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,525
As you can see here,
I can click Save.

79
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:49,860
And if I'm signed in, it prompts
me to immediately save it

80
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,390
to My Drive, and
then it lets me know

81
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,500
that it's been copied there.

82
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,800
Later on, I can go
into my Google Drive,

83
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,340
and I'll see that
this picture of a pug

84
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,540
has been successfully
saved there.

85
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,930
Much like the plus-one
social media button,

86
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,282
to use the Save to Drive
button, all we need

87
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:10,870
is some HTML and JavaScript.

88
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,950
First, you'll need to include
this Google JavaScript library.

89
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,339
Then, we need to create
an HTML element.

90
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,470
In this case, we're
going to use a div, which

91
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,560
has the class g-savetodrive.

92
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,710
This can be any HTML tag,

93
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,340
but it needs to have this class.

94
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,450
Then we need to declare
a couple data attributes,

95
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:32,050
the first of which is going to
be the URL of the file, where

96
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,600
the file is located.

97
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,620
Next will be what we want to
call this file on Google Drive.

98
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,380
And lastly, we'll
include our website name.

99
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,700
This is going to appear
on the Permission Window

100
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,116
when we ask the user if they
want to save it to the Drive.

101
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,490
And that's all there
really is to it.

102
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,354
From here, you can jump
into the challenges

103
00:04:52,354 --> 00:04:54,020
and try to create
your own Drive button,

104
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,030
or skip to the next video,
or one of the future levels

105
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,140
if there's something specific
you want to learn about.
