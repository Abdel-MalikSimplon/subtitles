1
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:05,450
So that's how you download a
file into your application.

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,110
But what if you
wanted to provide

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,050
a link that the
user could download

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,510
this file from in their browser?

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,410
You wouldn't give
them the download URL.

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:20,790
What you would give them, though,
is the data.webContentLink.

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,410
However, this URL is only going
to be useful to this user,

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,630
because it's inside their
Google Drive account.

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,250
If they took this URL and shared
it with someone else-- well,

10
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,150
they would see 403.

11
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:38,120
It's an error because they
don't have access to this file.

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,670
This is where
permissions come in.

13
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,730
And the Google API
gives us the ability

14
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,380
to manage file permissions.

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,040
And file permissions
come in three parts.

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,440
The role-- basically what a user
can do with the file; type--

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,370
what type of user we're
granting access to;

18
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,650
and value-- specifying
an identifier

19
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,970
for that type of user,
such as email address.

20
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,350
The most common roles
you'll encounter

21
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,960
are owner, writer, and reader.

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,510
The owner can read, modify,
comment on, and delete.

23
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:14,150
The writer can read, modify,
and comment on the file.

24
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,610
And the reader obviously
can just read it.

25
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:22,290
You can read more about roles
at this URL on Google's website.

26
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,670
Using types and
values, we can specify

27
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,280
what user or group of
users gets assigned

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,890
to the role we just specified.

29
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,670
If we specify user as
a type, then our value

30
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,250
is going to be a
user's email address.

31
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,560
If we specify a
group, the value is

32
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,460
going to be a group's
email address.

33
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,950
If we specify a
domain, the value

34
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,480
is going to be the
Google Apps domain.

35
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,890
And if we specify
anyone as a type,

36
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,530
then the value
doesn't really matter,

37
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,360
because this link is
going to be public.

38
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,380
You can read more about
types and values here.

39
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,380
Let's create a
permission that gives

40
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,990
a friend of ours, an
individual, access

41
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:02,770
to read one of our pug images.

42
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:07,460
So here we'd specify the
role of reader, the type

43
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,039
to user, because this
is an individual.

44
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,130
And the value would be
their email address.

45
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,810
We now need to make an API call
to the permissions.insert API

46
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,140
method, passing in as the body
object the permission object

47
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:27,800
we just created, and specifying
in the parameters which

48
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,980
file we're setting
permissions on.

49
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,039
The response will simply contain
details about the permission,

50
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:37,080
letting us know that it
was successfully created.

51
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,120
The user will be automatically
notified via email

52
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,580
that they've been granted
read access to this file.

53
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,910
The email might look
something like this.

54
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,930
The user can open the file by
clicking the link in the email.

55
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,460
Or if they go to
their Google Drive

56
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,850
and click on the Shared
With Me navigation link,

57
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,530
they'll see that this file
was shared with them in Drive.

58
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,990
Now it's time for a few more
challenges on permissions.
