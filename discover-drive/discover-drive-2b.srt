1
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:02,960
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,020
So in the previous level,
we saw how Google Picker

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,550
allows us to take file
uploads and bring them

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,290
right into a user's
Google Drive.

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,390
But once it's there, how does
our application get notified

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,304
where that file's
located on their drive.

7
00:00:18,304 --> 00:00:19,345
How does it get that URL?

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,520
Well if we look at our
current application,

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,760
and we select a file, and
hit that Select button,

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,680
well, it's not going to work.

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,490
And that's because we
need to specify a callback

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,960
function to receive
information about the file that

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,420
was selected.

14
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,520
Let's see how to do that.

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,390
What we need to do is add
another change function,

16
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,930
the setCallback function.

17
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,500
And then we're going to specify
the pickerCallback function,

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,300
which we're going to define now.

19
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,320
This function receives some
data, which contains information

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,724
about the file, and the action
that triggered the callback.

21
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,390
The first thing we
might want to do here

22
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:03,000
is check to see if
the action is picked,

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,670
which is triggered when the
user picks or uploads a file.

24
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,355
We can also check to see if the
user hit Cancel, in which case

25
00:01:10,355 --> 00:01:14,770
it will return
the cancel action.

26
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,870
In this data object,
we can access things

27
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:21,420
about the file, like the
name, description, and URL.

28
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,330
In our case, we're just
going to print out an alert

29
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,720
to the screen with
the URL of the file.

30
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,990
Now you might notice here
that docs is an array.

31
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,350
That's because sometimes
we might allow a user

32
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:40,140
to select multiple files
inside of our Google Picker.

33
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,840
There are a lot of
other properties

34
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,410
about a file that you
might want to access,

35
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,196
including its content.

36
00:01:46,196 --> 00:01:47,570
And we'll show
you how to do that

37
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,400
using the Drive API
in future levels.

38
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,900
If we ran this code
and selected a file,

39
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,360
you can see here
that an alert pops up

40
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,570
with the URL where we can access
the file we just selected.

41
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,780
If we do want to allow our
user to select multiple files,

42
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,410
we need to enable
that as a feature

43
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,470
by using the enableFeature
method, like you see here,

44
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,360
with MULTISELECT_ENABLED.

45
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,240
We can also disable
features with

46
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,952
the disableFeature function.

47
00:02:17,952 --> 00:02:19,410
And you can find
a list of features

48
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,170
at this URL on the slide.

49
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,510
That's the end of level two.

50
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,470
It's time for you to
complete your Google Picker.

51
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,050
And I'll see you
in the next level.
