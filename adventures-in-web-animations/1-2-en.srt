00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,060
Welcome back.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,900
This is section two of
the transitions level,

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,710
and we'll be talking about
transitioning position.

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,200
So far, you've seen us use
transitions to smoothly change

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,480
the background color and the
text color on this button.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,470
However, moving
in hidden content

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,430
is another common use
case for transitions.

8
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,070
So with this
button, let's say we

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,595
want to show perhaps the price
of the game on hover as well.

10
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:28,720
Well, how could we do this?

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,886
Let's go ahead and find out.

12
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,929
So here's our
current button HTML.

13
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:36,470
There's going to
be a couple steps

14
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,980
to achieve this transitioning
in hidden content

15
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,290
that we want to do.

16
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,830
The first is to create
the two inner spans--

17
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,660
one that will hold
the current Buy

18
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,060
Now content, and another that
will show the hidden text

19
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,300
content.

20
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,450
We'll also want to style
the initial and hover

21
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,410
states of these spans.

22
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,200
And then, we'll want to create a
transition between the hover

23
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:56,980
and initial state.

24
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,930
To start, let's go ahead
and create this span.

25
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,099
We'll wrap the Buy
Now with a span

26
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,040
and give it a class
of top content.

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,190
We'll then create a
second span, give it

28
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,673
a class of bottom content,
and say On Sale $59.

29
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,110
For the second step, we'll want
to style the initial position

30
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,830
of each of the spans.

31
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,320
So first, we'll call out the
Big Momma wrapper, the .btn,

32
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,600
and we'll give it a
position of relative.

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,030
Then, we'll call out
the two inner spans

34
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,500
with the class of content, and
give them position absolute.

35
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,870
Position absolute means position
me relative to my nearest

36
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,110
positioned parent or document.

37
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,160
In this case, it's our button.

38
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,620
Next, we'll set the positions
of both of the spans.

39
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,680
We'll set the top to be
zero, so it'll be snug up

40
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,545
against the top of the button.

41
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:56,010
And we'll set bottom
to be 100 pixels away

42
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,530
from the top of the button.

43
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,630
It'll be outside of
the visible area.

44
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,010
So when our button
is hovered, we

45
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,630
want to call it the
top class and give it

46
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,440
a top of negative 100 pixels.

47
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,240
We'll do the exact same
when the button is hovered.

48
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,630
We'll call it the bottom class
and give its top zero pixels.

49
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,690
This is going to give
this slide up effect.

50
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,900
So now on hover,
both of the spans

51
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,955
are popping up by 100 pixels.

52
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,500
We're getting close.

53
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,850
All we need to do
now is transition

54
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,780
these smoothly so it
looks like it's sliding up.

55
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,720
So now all we have
to do is transition

56
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,210
the top property
for 0.3 seconds.

57
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,710
If you go and hover
over the button,

58
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:49,380
you'll see instead of popping
up 100 pixels, they're both

59
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,670
sliding up nicely.

60
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,950
We can still see both
of our spans, though,

61
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,590
so inside the content
selector, we'll

62
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,770
just set overflow to hidden.

63
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,540
And now, our button looks
exactly as hoped for.

64
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,590
Go practice transitioning
position in the challenges,

65
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,590
and I'll see you back for the
last section of level one.
