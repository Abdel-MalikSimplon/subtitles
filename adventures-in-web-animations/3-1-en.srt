00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,790
[SINGING] Your website
is unused because

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,800
your users are confused. 

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,780
Bad UI can be
quite deadly.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,740
Let's make it
sweet and friendly.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,490
Make buttons
scale and skew.

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,700
Keyframes
animate it too.

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,790
Change color
and use easing.

8
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,460
The effect will
be quite pleasing.

9
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:22,830
Try rotations and
translations in

10
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,170
Adventures in Web Animations.

11
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:33,090
Welcome back to Adventures
in Web Animations.

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,750
This is level three where
we'll be talking about creating

13
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,980
and reusing keyframes.

14
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,230
So here's our site so far.

15
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,730
We've learned how to transform
elements and transition

16
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,950
properties that are
changing in CSS.

17
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,830
Our site's starting
to look pretty good.

18
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,740
So keyframe
animations are a list

19
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,540
of what should happen over the
course of the animation-- which

20
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,240
property should
change, how, and when.

21
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,200
We're used to, right now,
specifying a start state,

22
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,560
like a white star, and then
an end state of a purple star.

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,090
And then we're expecting the
transition to just make up

24
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,860
what happens between.

25
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,640
A keyframe animation,
however, allows

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,310
us to specify certain steps
throughout this animation.

27
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,830
At 25%, make the star pink.

28
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,810
At 50%, make it blue.

29
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,742
Before hitting the
end of the animation,

30
00:01:24,742 --> 00:01:25,950
when the star becomes purple.

31
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,870
We're going to start using
keyframes on our site

32
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,740
by animating this
donut character.

33
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,860
As you can see, he's
got a lot going on.

34
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,500
He's moving his
arms back and forth.

35
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,120
He's tapping his foot.

36
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,000
His icing is swinging
and the sprinkles

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,890
are flying off and disappearing.

38
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,230
But we're going to start simple.

39
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:49,480
Let's just start by swinging
his arm back and forth.

40
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,150
There are two parts to
keyframe animations.

41
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,000
First, create the animation.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,560
And then second,
assign the animation.

43
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,610
In order to create it,
we'll use this recipe here.

44
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,670
We'll declare the animation
with the at keyframes rule

45
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,610
and name it.

46
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,250
And then inside of
that, we'll define

47
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,270
the steps of the animation.

48
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:11,620
So for our donut, we'll call
it swing-- at keyframes swing.

49
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,730
This is a custom name.

50
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,170
It could be called
beau-knut-arm-swing.

51
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,380
But we'll keep it
short and simple.

52
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,420
Then inside, we'll specify
the two different steps,

53
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,880
our 0% for our first one,
and 100% for our second one.

54
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,320
We'll start off at transform
rotate zero degrees,

55
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,310
so I'm not moving at all.

56
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,450
But by the end of the
keyframe, at 100%,

57
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,720
I want it to say transform
rotate negative 10 degrees.

58
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,460
There are two ways to
define these inner steps.

59
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,540
You can do percentages,
like we've done here,

60
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,470
or you can use keywords "from"
and "to." "From" being the 0%,

61
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,650
"to" being 100%.

62
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,590
We've created the animation, but
our next step is to assign it.

63
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,260
To make this possible,
we've broken the PNG

64
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,360
into multiple elements each
with their own PNG inside.

65
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,050
So the left arm has
its own element.

66
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,650
The donut body has its own
element, so on and so forth.

67
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,680
In order to assign
the animation,

68
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,430
we'll select the left arm ID,
give it an animation property,

69
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,950
and then we'll
specify the values.

70
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,220
So first, the swing
name of the animation.

71
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,200
Then, the duration.

72
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,800
We'll give it two seconds.

73
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,880
The delay is next.

74
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,000
We want no delay, so
we'll say zero seconds.

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,770
Infinite iteration, which is
how many times it will loop.

76
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,980
And finally, the timing
function of ease.

77
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,770
The one important thing
to note is that duration

78
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,590
has to come before delay.

79
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,530
If you have two
numbers, it's always

80
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,350
going to take that first
number as your duration

81
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,255
and the second
number as your delay.

82
00:03:45,255 --> 00:03:48,110
If we go ahead and check back
in with our donut now,

83
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,340
you'll see that he's rotating,
but something, something

84
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,020
looks off.

85
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,560
Well, this is because transform
origin is set to center center.

86
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,620
If we specify a
different origin,

87
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,820
so that it's rotating
at top center,

88
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,470
it will rotate from the
shoulder instead of the elbow.

89
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,820
Our donut is now swinging
his arm to and fro quite nicely.

90
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,650
Let's reuse this keyframe
on the right arm now.

91
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,480
We'll go ahead and call
out the ID of right arm,

92
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,160
give it an animation,
swing two seconds infinite,

93
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,630
and then we'll also
change its origin

94
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,040
to transform origin top center.

95
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,715
Now as you can see, both of the
donut's arms are swinging.

96
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,390
Why don't you go practice
keyframes in the challenges,

97
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,220
and I'll see you back
for the next section.
