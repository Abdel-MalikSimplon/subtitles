00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,790
[SINGING] Your website
is unused because

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,800
your users are confused.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,780
Bad UI can be
quite deadly.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,740
Let's make it
sweet and friendly.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,490
Make buttons
scale and skew.

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,700
Keyframes
animate it too.

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,630
Change color
and use easing.

8
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,460
The effect will
be quite pleasing.

9
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:22,710
Try rotations and
translations in

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,583
Adventures in Web Animations.

11
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,720
Welcome back to level two in
Adventures in Web Animations.

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,660
This section, we'll be talking
about transforming rotate.

13
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,860
CSS transforms let
you modify elements

14
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,190
in their coordinate space.

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:51,820
They can be rotated, translated,
scaled, and even skewed.

16
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,700
In our application,
something fun

17
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,050
to animate that's part of our UI
could be this close icon on our

18
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,630
buy game form.

19
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,410
With transform, we can
easily rotate this.

20
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,330
We call out our
modal close on hover

21
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,210
and we say transform
rotate 360 degrees.

22
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:18,420
Rotate takes any number value
with a degree or a turn unit

23
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,520
suffix.

24
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,830
So transform rotate one turn
is the same as 360 degrees.

25
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,310
Our icon on hover, though, is
jumping from the start state

26
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,140
immediately to the end state.

27
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,050
You don't actually get
to see the rotation.

28
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,990
This is where transitions,
yet again, come to the rescue.

29
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,970
Inside our modal
close's initial state,

30
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,690
we'll say transition
transform four seconds.

31
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,790
Adding transition
transform allows

32
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,885
us to see the icon
changing on hover.

33
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:57,000
So far, we've only been using
the default timing function

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,310
of ease on our transitions.

35
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,730
However, we have this full
list here available to us.

36
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,270
So if we go ahead and
say transition transform

37
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,169
four seconds and use
ease out, for instance,

38
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:11,636
you'll see how the x
icon rotates slower

39
00:02:11,636 --> 00:02:12,885
near the end of the animation.

40
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,780
Go ahead and try your
hand at transforms,

41
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,320
and I'll see you in
the next section.
