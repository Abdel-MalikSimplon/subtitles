00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,790
[SINGING] Your website
is unused because

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,790
your users are confused.

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,780
Bad UI can be
quite deadly.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,740
Let's make it
sweet and friendly.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,490
Make buttons
scale and skew.

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,700
Keyframes
animate it too.

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,630
Change color
and use easing.

8
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,500
The effect will
be quite pleasing.

9
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,830
Try rotations and
translations in

10
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,570
Adventures in Web Animations.

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,050
Welcome back.

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,890
This is level four, SVG, in the
Adventures in Web Animations

13
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,340
course.

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,380
In this last section,
we'll be talking

15
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:44,230
about animating SVGs with CSS.

16
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,870
Our animating donut
is looking great so far.

17
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,480
The donut,
however, is comprised

18
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,340
of a ton of different pieces.

19
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,240
You have your arms, legs,
body, icing, icing outline.

20
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,240
The list goes on.

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,852
In order to be able
to animate each

22
00:00:58,852 --> 00:01:00,560
of these different
parts of our donut,

23
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,740
we'd have to separate them
all out into their own PNG

24
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,170
and then position
them on the page

25
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,130
so the donut looks
put together correctly.

26
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,020
If we use an SVG donut
image, however, we

27
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,240
will both have the access to
each of these inner pieces

28
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,970
that we want, and
it'll all be positioned

29
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,020
and put together correctly.

30
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,570
There are even some
things that are

31
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:27,350
impossible to do with PNG
that we can animate with SVG.

32
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,950
How do you get an
SVG asset, though?

33
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,290
Well, you can either
create your own asset

34
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,010
or find a free or
paid one online.

35
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,500
We created our donut
in Illustrator here.

36
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,010
And then we went and
named each of these layers

37
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,610
according to what it was.

38
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,610
So sprinkles, left
eye, mouth, etc.

39
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,850
When we saved it
out as an SVG file,

40
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:54,060
it had IDs inside the paths
that correlated to these layer

41
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,750
names, which was really handy.

42
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,910
SVG is a file format that
contains vector-based images.

43
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:07,750
Both SVG and HTML come
from the motherland of XML.

44
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,090
They look very, very similar.

45
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,880
As you can see, the SVG
version of our donut

46
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,970
looks the same and all of the
animations to both the arms

47
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,490
and the legs are
still happening.

48
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,950
This is because the IDs are the
same as the ones we are calling

49
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,590
out from the PNGs earlier.

50
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,910
The SVG is placed instead of
the PNG inside our HTML.

51
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,800
We simply go and grab this div
that had our PNG images inside

52
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,790
of it and replace it
with this large SVG.

53
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,290
Without any additional work,
if you command plus and zoom in

54
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,730
on our donut, you'll see
that he's as crisp as the day he

55
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,360
was first fried.

56
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,080
No matter how
much you zoom in,

57
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,650
this SVG will still look good.

58
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:09,330
Just as I mentioned earlier,
XML is very similar to HTML.

59
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,550
You can access any of
these specific tags

60
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,540
with CSS selectors, calling
out the tags themselves,

61
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,545
the IDs, classes.

62
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,270
Let's go ahead and call
out the ID of icing fill

63
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:29,230
and change its color, its
fill, to a darker pink.

64
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,420
We couldn't actually
do this with PNG,

65
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,760
so we're already getting
extra functionality.

66
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,950
We can now animate our
icing to this darker color.

67
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,560
We can create a
keyframe called darken.

68
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,250
It will start as pink and end
at this darker pink color.

69
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,280
We'll go ahead and call
out the icing fill ID

70
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,940
and give it an animation of
darken for three seconds.

71
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,100
We'll then have it
loop infinitely.

72
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,520
So as you can see,
our SVG donut

73
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,030
is getting a darker icing
over and over again.

74
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,650
You may have noticed that fill
is a new property that we're

75
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,600
using and there
happens to be quite

76
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,600
a lot of unique properties
when styling SVGs with CSS.

77
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,450
So here's a couple of them, like
fill opacity, filter, mask,

78
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,810
stroke, viewport fill.

79
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,340
You can check out the full
list here on the MDN website.

80
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,950
So here's our end goal of
where we want our animated SVG

81
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,850
donut to be.

82
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,940
So far, we've got the arms
moving, the foot stomping,

83
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,340
and the icing getting darker.

84
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,370
Next, let's go ahead and
work on those sprinkles

85
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,450
that are flying off.

86
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,500
We're going to create
a keyframe that's

87
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,570
animating multiple properties.

88
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,580
So hold on.

89
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,410
Let's go ahead and create
the flyoff keyframe.

90
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:02,040
And then, we'll specify
0 through 40% steps.

91
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,160
So 0, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%.

92
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,190
We'll then start rotating
the sprinkles back and forth.

93
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,930
This is going to create the
shaking motion that we want.

94
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:19,620
Next, at 45%, we're going
to set our opacity to 1.

95
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,060
This is getting us ready
to start fading them down.

96
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,040
At 50%, we want to rotate
the sprinkles even further

97
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,870
than they have been
before and start scaling

98
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,560
them to give a flyoff effect.

99
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,810
So we'll say transform
rotate 100 degrees.

100
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,790
Really rotate those sprinkles.

101
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,470
And then scale by a
multiplier of three.

102
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,610
Get three times as large.

103
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,300
We also at this point want
our opacity to be zero.

104
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,370
At 100%, our opacity is still
0, but let's set that transform

105
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,190
scale back down to normal size.

106
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,800
This is going to allow
it to have an easier

107
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,610
transition during the loop.

108
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,270
We've created the
flyoff keyframe,

109
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,080
but let's go ahead
and assign it.

110
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,610
We'll select the sprinkles ID.

111
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,190
We then also want to
transition the transform.

112
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,530
We'll give that a
two-second duration.

113
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:18,210
Transform origin, center,
center, you might think

114
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,360
should work.

115
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,810
But in fact, our donut
is taller than he is wide.

116
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,580
So the center of
our donut's body

117
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,160
is 302 pixels by 337 pixels.

118
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,400
Let's go ahead and specify
the center of his body

119
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,770
for the sprinkles
to rotate around.

120
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,230
We'll say animation
flyoff three seconds,

121
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,560
have it loop infinitely,
and let's give it

122
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,030
an ease-in timing function.

123
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,560
Some browsers don't
support key words

124
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,520
like center for
transform origin.

125
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,280
This is only for SVGs.

126
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,150
But just to be safe, let's
use pixels rather than

127
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,140
the key words.

128
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:02,310
So now our sprinkles are
flying off and disappearing

129
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,180
each time this animation loops.

130
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,530
The next part is going to
be shaking the icing back

131
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,730
and forth.

132
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,910
We can go ahead and take
that first part of 0

133
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,130
through 50, the shake that
we created on our flyoff

134
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:20,890
animation, and just use it
in a shake animation here.

135
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:24,310
We'll then assign that
to both our icing fill

136
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,740
and our icing outline.

137
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,230
We'll also need to
specify that same origin

138
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,480
of the middle of our donut.

139
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:40,160
If you scroll to the
bottom of our page here,

140
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,870
you'll see that our donut is
doing so many wonderful things.

141
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,130
It seems that he's getting
angry at his sprinkles

142
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,370
and shaking them off.

143
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,980
I hope you guys have
had fun learning

144
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,880
about animating on the web.

145
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,007
Go practice SVGs
in the challenges,

146
00:07:56,007 --> 00:07:57,840
and I'll see you back
for the wrap-up video.

147
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:10,280
[INAUDIBLE] Buckets of fish.

148
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,010
Rotate slowlier
when it's off hover.

149
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:13,620
Slowlier?

150
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,240
Slowlier.
