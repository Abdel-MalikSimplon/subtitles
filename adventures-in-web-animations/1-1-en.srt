00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,800
[SINGING] Your website
is unused because

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,800
your users are confused.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,780
Bad UI can be
quite deadly.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,500
Let's make it
sweet and friendly.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,500
Make buttons
scale and skew.

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,420
Keyframes
animate it too.

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,540
Change color
and use easing.

8
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,530
The effect will
be quite pleasing.

9
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,310
Try rotations and
translations in

10
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,170
Adventures in Web Animations.

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,340
Welcome to Adventures
in Web Animations.

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,880
My name is Alyssa Nicoll,
and I'll be your guide.

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,220
We guide users online
using the tools

14
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,450
that we have available like
color, font, and motion.

15
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,730
So in this course, we're going
to be diving specifically

16
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,480
into motion.

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,930
We'll learn how to create
helpful and fun animations

18
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:54,040
using transitions, transforms,
keyframe animations, and even

19
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,042
animating SVGs.

20
00:00:57,042 --> 00:00:58,750
Throughout this course,
we'll be learning

21
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,230
to animate this
site here, which is

22
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,720
selling Sweet Lands, the game.

23
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,760
You'll need a working
knowledge of HTML,

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,840
and CSS as a prereq
for this course.

25
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,590
A bit of JavaScript and jQuery
are helpful, but not required.

26
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,580
Welcome to level one,
transitions, where

27
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,910
we will be talking about
transitioning color.

28
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,980
Transitions cause
changes to a property

29
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,200
to take place over
a period of time.

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,240
So for instance, instead
of an element changing

31
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,740
color from white
to pink instantly,

32
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:34,600
transitions will cause this
to take place over time.

33
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,335
This period of time is
referred to as a duration.

34
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,400
We just talked
about all the things

35
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,250
we have available on
the web to guide users.

36
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,400
But guide them to what?

37
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,480
Well, a primary call
to action, or CTA,

38
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,430
is the primary goal for
a user on a web app.

39
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,170
And for our site,
this would be to

40
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,300
purchase the
Sweet Lands game.

41
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,690
So we're going to use
CSS transitions to make

42
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,100
this Buy Now button more of
a prominent call to action.

43
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,120
So we're going to
start off by styling

44
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,980
the initial and hover
background states of our button.

45
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,000
For the initial state, we'll
give it a lighter blue,

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,240
and then for the
hover state, we'll

47
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,880
give it a slightly darker blue.

48
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,860
One thing to note with
transitions like this,

49
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,690
is you can transition from a
keyword to a hex or from a hex

50
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,390
to RGB.

51
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:36,160
It doesn't have to be
the same type of value.

52
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,270
We have our initial
and hover states set.

53
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,870
So for any transition
that we're going to do,

54
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,280
we'll use this recipe.

55
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,280
We'll say transition,
and then give it

56
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,250
a property and a duration.

57
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,340
So for our button,
we'll say transition,

58
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,350
the property of
background color,

59
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,250
and then 0.4 seconds
for the duration.

60
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,540
As you can see here on our site,
when you hover over the button,

61
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,270
it's transitioning from this
lighter blue to a darker blue.

62
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,060
It's a good idea to stay
subtle with transitions

63
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,590
and only dramatize when you
really need to call attention

64
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,530
to an element.

65
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,740
And even then, be wary of
super crazy transitions.

66
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,770
The fastest transition
easily seen by the human eye

67
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:20,030
is 0.256 seconds, so anything
a lot faster than that

68
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,090
might not be noticeable.

69
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,700
You can transition
multiple properties

70
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,750
when they're comma separated.

71
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,300
So on hover, we've given the
text a slightly darker color.

72
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,420
To transition that color along
with the background color,

73
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,310
we say comma, color, and
then give it a duration.

74
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,150
We'll say 0.4 seconds.

75
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,090
And you can see here that on
hover, both the background

76
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,865
and the text color
are transitioning.

77
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,880
If you'll notice, both the
background color and the text

78
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,020
color have a 0.4
second duration.

79
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,760
We can shorten this by
using the all keyword

80
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,010
and just say all 0.4 seconds.

81
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,190
Be careful, though, because any
property that can animate will,

82
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,810
because we're saying
transition all properties.

83
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,130
As you can see
on the site, though,

84
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,795
it's still working
as expected.

85
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,720
Thus far, we've only been using
transitions with two values.

86
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,020
But there's actually four values
to a full transition recipe.

87
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,600
The property and the
duration, which we know about,

88
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,140
and then the timing
function and delay.

89
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,340
Technically, all that needs to
be specified is the duration.

90
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,930
The rest have defaults, like
the property defaults to all,

91
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,320
the timing function
defaults to ease,

92
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,450
and the delay defaults to zero.

93
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,660
So that means a
transition like this

94
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,660
that are specifying all
of the default values

95
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,810
can be shortened to just
transition 0.4 seconds.

96
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,570
You want to leave
the defaults out

97
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,980
unless you need to change them.

98
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,980
All of our examples thus far
and for the rest of the course

99
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,230
will be without vendor prefixes.

100
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:08,840
However, out in production,
you might need to use them.

101
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,860
Prefixes look like
this-- webkit, moz,

102
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,280
ms. They're just these
prefix-y keywords that go

103
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,980
before things like transition.

104
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:22,160
How do I know which property
will need a prefix, though,

105
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,080
and for what browser?

106
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,020
I personally like to use a
website called caniuse.com.

107
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,720
Here you simply
type in the thing

108
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,390
you're wanting to use, like
transition or keyframes,

109
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,940
and then it will list out
each of the browsers that

110
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,820
are compatible
with that and which

111
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,780
ones you need to use prefixes.

112
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,490
Sometimes browsers don't
even work with prefixes,

113
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,760
and you'll see those
highlighted in red.

114
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,930
Have fun practicing
transitioning color,

115
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,540
in the challenges, and I'll see
you back in the next section.
