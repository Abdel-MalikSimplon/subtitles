00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,450
Welcome back to level
two, section two,

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:09,650
where we'll be transforming
scale and translate.

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,890
Another good use of animation
on the web is form inputs.

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,110
We can create a cool
interactivity between our input

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,020
and our input label.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,240
As you can see here,
our input label

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,775
is animating between
two separate states.

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,510
If we break it down, we
can see that our input

9
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,210
label on its initial
state is acting as a text

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,820
placeholder over the input.

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,490
When the input is
focused on, we want

12
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,200
the label to slide
up and scale down,

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,810
becoming your average
label for an input.

14
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,700
We're also darkening the input
label on the focus state.

15
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:55,100
So let's start by transitioning
the color of the label.

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:01,070
So just as we've done before,
we'll set the initial color.

17
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,900
And then on input focus,
we'll set the focus color

18
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,670
for the label. 

19
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,890
Then, we'll transition the
color over 0.3 seconds.

20
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,570
I want to point out that we
use the adjacent selector here.

21
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,050
That's only going to select the
first label after each input.

22
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,740
This is important because you
might have multiple labels

23
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:26,160
or inputs inside a form.

24
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,840
So we've transitioned
color, and our next step

25
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,270
is going to be scaling it down
by 80%, as you can see here.

26
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,380
Scale is used to stretch
an element based on a value

27
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,430
multiplier that's passed in.

28
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,560
So if you only
pass in one value,

29
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,730
it's going to stretch it in
both directions by that value.

30
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,850
So for instance, if I
say transform scale two,

31
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:56,250
my box is going to grow double
the size on height and width.

32
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,120
We can also say
transform scale four two,

33
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,060
and this is going to stretch
it horizontally by four

34
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,540
and vertically by two.

35
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,990
You can specify the x
and y separately like so.

36
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,240
So when the input
is focused, we'll

37
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,020
add transform scale
0.8 to the form label.

38
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:25,410
We also want to transition
this by, we'll say, 0.3 seconds.

39
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,530
When you focus on the
input, though, you'll

40
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,680
notice that this
label is moving right.

41
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,140
We never specified a
change in position.

42
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,275
So why is this happening?

43
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,520
When you scale something down,
it maintains its original box

44
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,890
model size.

45
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,250
So for instance, let's
say our CC Number label

46
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,660
has 100 pixels in
height and 400 in width,

47
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,650
no matter how small you
scale it down, this label's

48
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:56,850
always going to
take up 100 by 400.

49
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,650
So here we have an input
and an input label.

50
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:05,420
The dashed line specifies
the label's element size.

51
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,110
Here's our desired focus
state with it scaling down

52
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,660
80% of its original size.

53
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,390
And the current focus state,
which is also scaling down

54
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,580
80% of its original size.

55
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,000
However, it's doing
this from its center.

56
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,310
An easy fix to this is to simply
specify a different origin.

57
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,800
We can say transform
origin center left--

58
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,160
center being the y origin,
and left being the x origin.

59
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,520
Once we specify left
for our x origin,

60
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,220
we'll be transforming
along the left side,

61
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,910
and this will give us
our desired focus state.

62
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,790
We can set this transform
origin in either keywords,

63
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,480
like center right
top, or in pixels.

64
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:58,270
So to put this into practice,
in the initial state of the form

65
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:02,520
input label, we'll say
transform origin center left.

66
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,270
Now when it's clicked, both
the color and the scale

67
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,115
change along the left side.

68
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:17,790
Our third and final step is
to translate up, or move it up,

69
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,890
above the input.

70
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,920
So translate simply
means to move.

71
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,570
We could say transform
translate x by three pixels,

72
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,740
and all that's saying
is move right three.

73
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,720
We can say translate
y negative 3 pixels,

74
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,600
and that will move up three.

75
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,794
We can also say
translate three pixels

76
00:04:40,794 --> 00:04:42,210
and this is going
to use the three

77
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,830
pixels for both the
x and the y value,

78
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,330
moving us down and
to the right by three.

79
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,990
Now when the input
is focused, we'll

80
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:58,010
set our form label to
transform translate y

81
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,840
by negative 40 pixels--

82
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,120
move up 40 pixels.

83
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,430
We are already
transitioning our transform.

84
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:10,020
So both scale and translate
are being transitioned.

85
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,200
We could shorten this, however,
to use the all keyword.

86
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,240
So now, when you
click on the input,

87
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,920
our label changes color,
scales down by 80%,

88
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,995
and moves up 40 pixels--
all with a nice, smooth transition.

89
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,170
Now it's time for you to
practice transforming scale

90
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,410
and translate.

91
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,330
I'll see you back
in the next level.
