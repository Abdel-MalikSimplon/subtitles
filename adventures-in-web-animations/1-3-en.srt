1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,250
Welcome back to
level one, transitions.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:05,920
You're in the final
section, where we'll

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,400
be transitioning visibility.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,830
So here's our
current application

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,770
with our snazzy button.

6
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,200
It's doing the background,
the color, and hidden content

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,070
that are all transitioning in.

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,880
When we click on the
button, however, we

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,420
have a form that just
pops in instantly,

10
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,170
and this seems like
a perfect place

11
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,315
to go ahead and use our
knowledge of transitions.

12
00:00:29,254 --> 00:00:31,170
So here's the form that
we're going to display

13
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,860
when the button is clicked.

14
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,090
There are three main parts.

15
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,554
There's the modal header, which
has the close icon and the H3.

16
00:00:39,554 --> 00:00:41,970
There's the modal content,
which contains the form and all

17
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,390
the input goodies.

18
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,530
And then lastly, there's
the modal overlay,

19
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,030
which is this big, semi-opaque
purple box covering up

20
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,920
our background.

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,320
Just like we did
with the button,

22
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,986
we're going to want
to style the initial

23
00:00:54,986 --> 00:00:57,190
and the hover
state of the modal.

24
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,470
So we'll call out the modal
and the modal overlay,

25
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,760
and we'll give them a
visibility of hidden

26
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,530
and an opacity of zero.

27
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,390
We don't want them
showing up initially.

28
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,350
Then we want the modal
when it's active

29
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:13,720
and the modal overlay when it's
active, to have an opacity of one

30
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,090
and a visibility of visible.

31
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,030
You might be wondering why
we're using both opacity zero

32
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,350
and visibility hidden.

33
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,420
Why not one or the other?

34
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,250
Well, opacity zero
hides the element,

35
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,820
but it still takes up the same
amount of width and height

36
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,760
on the page.

37
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,970
So it would be blocking
anything else on the screen.

38
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,100
So visibility hidden
comes in and makes

39
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,630
the element transparent
to these click events.

40
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,470
This might also
have you thinking,

41
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,630
why not just use display none?

42
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,290
Why use opacity and
visibility at all?

43
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,880
Well, as it turns out,
not all properties

44
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,360
are transitionable in CSS.

45
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,450
So when transitioning, use
both opacity and visibility

46
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:03,980
instead of display none

47
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:08,259
So now let's transition the
opacity for 0.5 seconds.

48
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:11,150
You'll see, though, that
it's disappearing right away.

49
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,470
Something's not quite right.

50
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,070
What happened to
our whole fade out?

51
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,780
Well, we need to transition
both the visibility

52
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,580
property and our opacity.

53
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,080
We'll just comma separate that
and say visibility 0.5 seconds.

54
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,960
Or, as we learned
before, you just

55
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,460
say transition all 0.5 seconds.

56
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,240
And now, on button
click, you can

57
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,830
see that the modal
and modal overlay

58
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,070
are transitioning in and out.

59
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,090
Just as with display,
we'll be running

60
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,940
across this multiple times, of
what properties can transition.

61
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,630
A good rule of thumb is,
does it have a middle state?

62
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,350
So with opacity, our
start state was zero

63
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,420
and our end state was one.

64
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,750
So our theoretical middle
transition state would be 0.5.

65
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,170
So yes, it transitions.

66
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,270
Display, however, has
a start state of none

67
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,520
and an end state of block.

68
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,510
So its transitioning middle
state would be sort of?

69
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:12,190
No.

70
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,865
It's definitely
not transitionable.

71
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,340
The properties that can
be transitioned in CSS

72
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,660
are always being
updated, so make sure

73
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,420
you check out the
full list on the web.

74
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,920
Have fun transitioning
visibility in the challenges,

75
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,910
and I'll see you
back in level two.
