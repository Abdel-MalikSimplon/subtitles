00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,980
Welcome back to level three.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,027
We're on section two.

3
00:00:05,027 --> 00:00:06,860
We'll be talking about
multi-step keyframes.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,610
Our donut's arms are
swinging, but the swing

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,680
doesn't feel quite right
with only two steps.

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,400
Let's go ahead
and add more steps

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,350
so that our swing animation
looks more natural.

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,070
So in between our
start and end state,

9
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:27,090
we'll add a 25%,
50%, and 75% step.

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,120
We'll have it rotate between
negative 10 degrees to 0

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,585
and then up to 10 degrees.

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,495
So let's say we give
the swing animation

13
00:00:40,495 --> 00:00:42,960
a duration of 2 seconds.

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,210
At 25% of 2 seconds,
we'll be at 0.5 seconds.

15
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,670
And then at 50%,
we'll be at 1 second,

16
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,660
and 75%, we'll be at 1.5 seconds.

17
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,170
Because we've spaced
these out evenly,

18
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,295
our animation is
nice and linear.

19
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,930
If we wanted the animation
to be faster at the beginning

20
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,550
and then slower at the end, we
could change our percentages

21
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,490
to 10%, 20%, and then 30%.

22
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,131
This would then cause
an ease-out spacing

23
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:16,130
so that it happens really
quick at the beginning

24
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,250
and then slow near the end.

25
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,130
Instead of manually spacing
out the steps of the keyframe,

26
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,050
however, if you want
an ease-out feel,

27
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,240
simply use an ease-
out timing function

28
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,657
to do this work for you.

29
00:01:30,786 --> 00:01:34,300
You may have noticed that
our start state, end state,

30
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,670
and middle state are all the
same of rotate 0 degrees.

31
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,170
We can condense
these duplicate lines

32
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,310
by comma separating
the percent values.

33
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,500
Both of our arms are
rotating right and left

34
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,050
at the same time.

35
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,580
However, we want one to
move left and the other one

36
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,170
to move right at the
same time-- opposites.

37
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,004
There are two ways
we can achieve this.

38
00:02:02,004 --> 00:02:04,500
First off, we can write two
completely different keyframes--

39
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,690
one with negative 10
degrees at the same time

40
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,139
as this one is
positive 10 degrees.

41
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,890
Or we could just use a delay
with the same keyframe.

42
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,330
So if we go ahead back in
to our right arm selector,

43
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,910
we can add a one-second delay,
giving the right arm a delay

44
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,630
so it starts halfway through
the left arm's animation.

45
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,000
You'll see now our donut
pauses his right arm

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,420
for a second, and then both arms
continue out and in together.

47
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,950
Let's create one final keyframe
before the challenges.

48
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,480
How about that left foot?

49
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,100
In order to get it to tap,
we'll create an at keyframes

50
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,970
tap animation.

51
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,530
We'll give it a
start and end state

52
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,170
where its translate y is at 0--
so exactly where your foot is.

53
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:03,170
But in the middle, we want
to translate y up 5 pixels.

54
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,420
We've created the
animation, but remember,

55
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,550
you have to assign it as well.

56
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,810
So let's go ahead and
call out that left leg ID,

57
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:16,985
give it an animation property
with a tap 1 second infinitely.

58
00:03:16,985 --> 00:03:19,330
If you'll look at our
donut now, both his arms

59
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,350
are swinging, and his
left foot is tapping.

60
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,140
Now it's time for you to
practice multi-step keyframes

61
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,040
in the challenges.

62
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,010
I'll see you back for the
final section of level three.
