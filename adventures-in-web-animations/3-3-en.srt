00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:03,640
Welcome back to level
three. We'll be talking

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,820
about more advanced
keyframes in this third section.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,030
Our application is
looking great so far,

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,770
but there are some complicated
use cases out there

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,240
that keyframes can
be used to solve.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,380
For instance, instead of just
transitioning in our modal,

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,340
we could have it
overshoot while fading in.

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,720
Keyframes would be perfect
for this kind of animation.

9
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,430
So let's analyze
what we actually need

10
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,600
to do to create this effect.

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,710
There are multiple
elements that are animating

12
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,580
with different properties.

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,370
First, you have the overlay.

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,470
It's simply fading in.

15
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,200
Next, you have the
modal as a whole.

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,250
It's sliding up and fading in.

17
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,440
Thirdly, you have the
insides of the modal.

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,110
These small pieces are
fading in and sliding up

19
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,710
at a different rate than
the modal as a whole,

20
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,140
to give it a fun jump effect.

21
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,940
First, let's take care of
the fading in modal overlay.

22
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,840
We want it to start
off hidden, and then

23
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,850
have an end state of visible.

24
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,380
Notice we're putting it all
inside of a fade in keyframe.

25
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,890
This is because we're
going to reuse this fade in

26
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,980
on all three parts.

27
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,690
We'll then assign
this fade in animation

28
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,250
to the modal overlay, when
it has the class of active.

29
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,720
We'll also give it a
0.25 second duration.

30
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,550
If we go ahead and
click on the button,

31
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,280
you'll see the
modal overlay comes

32
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,230
in as expected, but
disappears right away.

33
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,240
This is because of fill mode.

34
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,310
We've been using fill mode's
default state of none.

35
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,340
However, if we simply
change it to forwards,

36
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,260
fill mode forward is going to
set the animation's final state

37
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,580
to the last specified step.

38
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,880
So we click on the button,
the modal overlay fades in,

39
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,655
and it stays at that
final visible step.

40
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,100
Next, we want to go ahead
and tackle the sliding up

41
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,070
and fading in modal as a whole.

42
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,130
We've created a
fade in keyframe,

43
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,790
but let's create a
slide up keyframe.

44
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,850
It will start low on the page,
so transform translate y,

45
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,280
we'll say 400 pixels.

46
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,150
And it'll end
higher on the page,

47
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,850
so transform translate
y negative 300 pixels.

48
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:36,040
So we'll specify the
animation property.

49
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,910
We'll say slide up for
0.65 seconds duration

50
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,180
and give it a half
a second delay.

51
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,345
And then of course we'll
specify fill mode of forwards.

52
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,120
So our modal is
sliding up as expected.

53
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,780
However, our end goal was that
it would overshoot a little bit

54
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,370
and come back down.

55
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,910
We can achieve this with a
custom cubic bezier timing

56
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,950
function.

57
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:09,080
We simply say cubic bezier
and give it four numbers here.

58
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,305
This is going to achieve this
overshoot effect that we want.

59
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,760
What is a cubic bezier
though, and what

60
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,720
on earth are these numbers?

61
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,150
Well a cubic bezier
is just a curve

62
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:28,000
that is specifying how fast
a property changes over time.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,880
These numbers are
what makes that curve.

64
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,230
All timing functions
behind the scenes

65
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,970
are cubic bezier at heart,
so the linear, the ease,

66
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,010
the ease in, all of
these have a cubic bezier

67
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,420
recipe that makes them happen.

68
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,200
You don't need to worry about
recreating these with numbers

69
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,760
so much, just know that they
all are cubic bezier at heart.

70
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,430
An important thing
to note, is that

71
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,030
no matter which timing
function you use,

72
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,240
the start and finish
times are always the same.

73
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,520
The curves don't
change the duration,

74
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,220
they change how
the value changes

75
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,090
between start and finish.

76
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,690
So we created this sliding
up overshooting keyframe

77
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,570
and assigned it to
our modal when active.

78
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,700
Let's go ahead and use
the fade in keyframe

79
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,959
that we made earlier as well.

80
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,780
We'll say fade in
0.65 second duration,

81
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,755
with a 0.5 second delay
and fill mode forwards.

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,970
Let's go ahead and
finish up, by sliding up

83
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,740
the insides at a different
pace than the modal as a whole.

84
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,400
We'll create a slide
up small keyframe.

85
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,720
We'll say from transform
translate y 80 pixels,

86
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,970
and then to transform
translate y zero.

87
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,930
We'll then assign this
slide up small and our fade

88
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,670
in to the modal innards, the
H3 and the form field, when

89
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,195
it's active.

90
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,040
On button click, our
form is now overshooting,

91
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,980
the insides are doing a
slightly different jump,

92
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,170
and the background is fading in.

93
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,330
Go ahead and get some practice
with those more complex

94
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,120
keyframes, and I'll see
you back in the last level.
