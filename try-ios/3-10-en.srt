1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,710
One more section before we get
done with level three.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:07,130
What we want to do here is
build out our profile.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,790
So we might want to display not
only the profile image,

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,570
but the name, city, biography,
and member since.

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,320
So here we are back in our
ProfileViewController.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,090
There's the image
we just created.

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,270
That's our old code.

8
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,290
Let's first make this a smaller
profile image to make

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,690
some room for the text that
we're going to be

10
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,390
putting on the page.

11
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,550
One way we can do that is by
setting the frame equal to a

12
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:33,320
CG rectangle, where we specify
the x-y width and height.

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:33,690
Cool.

14
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,620
So now this is what our screen
currently looks like with our

15
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,850
picture up there.

16
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,770
Now we need to add some more
views, maybe a UILabel,

17
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,450
another UILabel for city, a
UITextView for biography

18
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,940
because, well, it's going to be
a paragraph of information,

19
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,670
and then another UILabel
for member since.

20
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,490
So jumping back into our
ProfileViewController, here's

21
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,130
our UILabel.

22
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,980
This code should
look familiar.

23
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:05,010
Then a city label, and then our
UITextView, which is new.

24
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,120
And we're going to initialize
it by sending

25
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,490
in rectangle again.

26
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,760
Then we can set the
font because we

27
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,340
want a smaller font.

28
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,160
By default, a UITextView is
editable, so we want to set it

29
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,390
to not be editable.

30
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,840
So we'll send in no.

31
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,300
And then we add the text and
add it as a subview.

32
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,326
Lastly, we're going to add
the memberSince UILabel.

33
00:01:26,326 --> 00:01:27,510
And that's about it.

34
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,730
So now if we go back into
our view, it looks

35
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,660
something like this.

36
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,910
And if we--

37
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,850
Where did member since go?

38
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,770
Yeah, Mr. Higgie, where did
our member since go?

39
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,850
It's sort of getting hidden
behind there, and for some

40
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,470
reason, we can't scroll
down to see it.

41
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:49,460
Well, that's because we need to
learn about UIScrollView.

42
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,390
It's pretty common in lots of
iOS applications to have a big

43
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,380
screen worth of data, and you
can scroll down to see the

44
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:55,880
rest of it.

45
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,090
Sometimes you can scroll
vertically, sometimes even

46
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,440
horizontally.

47
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,050
So we need to implement
a scroll view to

48
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,320
be able to do that.

49
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,140
So the first step is to declare
a property in our

50
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,240
header file called
UIScrollView.

51
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,740
And inside of our
ProfileViewController, we're

52
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,540
going to initialize that
scrollView, set it to the

53
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,760
bounds of the view that we're
putting it inside.

54
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,900
Now we need to set
the content size.

55
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,020
And this is probably
going to be bigger

56
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,150
than the frame, right?

57
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,360
Because we want to be able to
scroll down to other items.

58
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,110
So we need to specify in here
the content size for the total

59
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,480
amount of space we want
to be able to

60
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,090
scroll within the frame.

61
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,400
How do we figure that out?

62
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,010
Well, one way to figure
that out is to

63
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,790
look at the last UILabel.

64
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,350
We can see here that the
y-coordinate is 440, and its

65
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,980
total height is 40.

66
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,640
So if we add these together,
we're going to get the total

67
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,890
content size that we want to
be able to scroll down to.

68
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,860
In this case, it's 480.

69
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,190
The next thing we have to
change inside of our

70
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,200
ProfileViewController is
whenever we go to add

71
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,410
subviews, instead of adding them
to the view controller's

72
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,280
main view, we're going
to add these sub views

73
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,800
into our scroll view.

74
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,060
Here we add biography as a
subview to scroll view.

75
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,940
Then lastly, we're going to want
to add the scroll view

76
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,120
itself as a subview on to our
main ViewController view.

77
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,990
So here we are back
in our app.

78
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,900
Now we can scroll.

79
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,072
Hey, wait a second.

80
00:03:32,072 --> 00:03:33,524
Where did we go wrong?

81
00:03:33,524 --> 00:03:35,460
The scroll doesn't stick!

82
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:35,900
You see that?

83
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,410
We're scrolling up, but
it's not sticking.

84
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,870
For some reason, we can't
scroll down to

85
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,690
that and let go.

86
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,410
I wonder what went wrong.

87
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,130
Well, in order to figure that
out, we need to understand a

88
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,950
little bit about how things
get resized inside iOS.

89
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,530
So inside of our
ProfileViewController, it's

90
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,970
320 by 460.

91
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,760
You might be wondering why
it's 460 and not 480.

92
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,350
Well, that's because the time
and your cell carrier little

93
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,730
line at the top, that
takes up 20 points.

94
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,230
So that's why this
is 320 by 460.

95
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,190
Then we're setting the
scrollView's frame to the same

96
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,990
as the profileViewController's
frame.

97
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,560
This needs to go inside the
tabBarController, which has a

98
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,839
320 by 460 frame.

99
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,800
When the profileViewController
gets displayed inside the tab

100
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,550
bar, the profileViewController
by default gets resized to 320

101
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,650
by 411, as you would hope.

102
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,600
However, the scrollView
does not get resized.

103
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,730
We need some way of telling
the scrollView to resize

104
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:38,180
itself when the view that
it's in gets resized.

105
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,710
We can do this by specifying
the autoresizingMask on the

106
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,420
scrollView, which we're
setting here to

107
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,780
be a flexible height.

108
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,020
Here are a bunch of other resize
settings that you might

109
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,920
want to use.

110
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,680
Sometimes you might even want
to use two at the same time,

111
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,960
in the case where you have a
view that you want to be

112
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,610
flexible both for height
and width.

113
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,160
This is useful if you're
switching an app into

114
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,650
landscape view, for example.

115
00:05:05,934 --> 00:05:07,720
So here we are again.

116
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:13,215
And now we can scroll,
and it sticks.

117
00:05:13,215 --> 00:05:16,540
Scrolly goodness!

118
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,070
Awesome.

119
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:22,170
Now it's time for you to add
another UILabel to the profile

120
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,540
and adjust the scrollView
accordingly.

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,292
