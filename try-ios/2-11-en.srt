1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,690
All right, so let's take
another look at this

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:03,800
code we have here.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,650
In the viewDidLoad we declare
two buttons, then we have the

4
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,650
buttonPressed method.

5
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,210
There's a couple things that
kind of suck about this code.

6
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,792
I'm going to let Mr. Higgie
point them out.

7
00:00:13,792 --> 00:00:17,260
We're doing a comparison
on the button title.

8
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:17,830
Right.

9
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,720
We're doing a comparison on a
title, which may not be the

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,030
safest thing to do.

11
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,892
There's going to be a better
way to do that comparison.

12
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:29,100
The variable names are awful.

13
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,280
Right, and the variable names
don't really say what they

14
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,110
do-- we've got first button
and second button.

15
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,920
So let's fix that right now.

16
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,100
The first thing that we're
going to do to clean this

17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,460
stuff up is inside of our

18
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,370
ViewController.h, our header file.

19
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,810
We're going to declare
two properties,

20
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,990
for each of our UIButtons.

21
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,340
This is a pretty common pattern
you'll see in iOS

22
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,450
applications, where all the
different subviews we declare

23
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,550
as properties on the
ViewController they're going

24
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,790
to be displayed in.

25
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:05,480
So we have our 50button, our
100button, then inside of

26
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,770
our ViewController.m,
here's the old code.

27
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,930
Let's go ahead and revise it
to use these @properties.

28
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,430
All we have to do is use
self.fiftyPercentButton in

29
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,160
many different places, as
well as doing that with

30
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,470
self.hundredPercentButton
for the other button.

31
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,090
But I'm not going to
show you that.

32
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,100
Now how do we improve
the conditional?

33
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,820
Here's our conditional, where
we're comparing two strings.

34
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,640
Well now that our entire class
has access to these UIButton

35
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:37,110
properties, we can use those to
check to see if the sender

36
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,960
is equal to the 50button.

37
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,220
In case you're wondering, that
isEqual method comes from NS

38
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,440
object, which all objects
in iOS inherit from.

39
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,160
It's the most root object.

40
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,920
Much cleaner.

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,950
Now it's time for you to clean
up some of your code.

42
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,200
And I'll see you
in level three.

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,148
